Succotash has earned its place of pride in regions across the U.S. \u2014 the Midwest, the Eastern Seaboard, and perhaps most notably, the South. This succotash is Cajun-style and a worthy entree, thanks to spicy Andouille sausage and seasoned shrimp. But feel free to leave them out for a satisfying meatless option. The Andouille sausage adds kick, so if you use regular sausage or eliminate it altogether, you can add some heat with ground cayenne and hot sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/21/dining/vl-succotash/merlin_175613226_7b3e4dff-600f-4573-b880-6442ba02a7b4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "andouille sausage, corn, lima beans, okra, shrimp, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1380}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/1 pound fresh (shelled) or frozen butter beans or baby lima beans", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "3 cups/12 ounces fresh or frozen okra, tops and tails trimmed, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil or unsalted butter", "6 ounces Andouille sausage, diced", "1 large yellow onion, diced", "1/2 large green bell pepper, diced", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "5 medium ears corn, kernels sliced off (about 3 1/2 cups)", "2 large ripe tomatoes, coarsely chopped", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed", "1 pound shrimp (any size), peeled and deveined", "1/2 packed cup fresh basil leaves, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
