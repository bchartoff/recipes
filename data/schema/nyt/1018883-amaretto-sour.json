{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Amaretto Sour", "description": "Jeffrey Morgenthaler, the bar manager of P\u00e9p\u00e9 Le Moko and Clyde Common in Portland, Ore., enjoyed amaretto sours as a young man. As a bartender, he embarked on a project to make a better version of this often-mocked drink, which was typically composed of just amaretto and sour mix. He boosted the alcoholic strength by mixing in nearly a full ounce of overproof bourbon, replaced the sour mix with real lemon juice and added an egg white \u2014 a common ingredient in many sour recipes from the past. Given all the alterations, he might have given the cocktail a new name, but decided against that. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t have been any point,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between if I took this drink and made it good, and if I invented a new drink with amaretto. The latter wouldn\u2019t have the same gravitas.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/09/dining/09BADDRINK4/09BADDRINK4-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "amaretto, bourbon, brandied cherries", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 60}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 215, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "31 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces amaretto", "3/4 ounce cask-proof bourbon, such as Booker\u2019s", "1 ounce fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon rich simple syrup (2 parts sugar to 1 part water; see note)", "1/2 ounce egg white, beaten", "Lemon twist, for garnish", "Brandied cherries, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the amaretto, bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white in a cocktail shaker and shake without ice, about 10 seconds, to integrate.
