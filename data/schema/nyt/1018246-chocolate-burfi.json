{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Burfi", "description": "Burfi is a very sweet Indian candy \u2014 similar to fudge, but slightly earthier and more milky \u2014 that is typically made with some combination of milk, sugar, ghee and flavorings. In Indian culture, burfi is often given as a gift, accompanying any kind of celebration: a birthday, a holiday, even a simple get-together of friends. This recipe, adapted from Raja Sweets in Houston, caters to those looking for an accessible entry point to the world of burfi; it offers a slight variation on the basic formula by adding a layer of cocoa-infused khoya (the name for the milky base).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/17/dining/17RAJA4/17RAJA4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "16 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "candies", "keywords": "cocoa powder, ghee, milk powder, rose water, sweetened condensed milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 77}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 249, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "62 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup ghee (or use melted butter), plus more for greasing the pan", "1 tablespoon cocoa powder", "2/3 cup sugar", "2 cups sweetened condensed milk (a little less than two 14-ounce cans)", "2 cups powdered milk", "2 drops rose water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly grease only the sides of an 8-by-8-inch pan with ghee.
