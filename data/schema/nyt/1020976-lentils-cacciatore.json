This braise\u2019s cozy, deep flavors are equally tasty with red lentils in place of the poultry. In less than half an hour, red lentils break down to create a creamy, rich vegetarian stew. Carrots and red peppers make it a hearty meal, but you could also eat it over pasta, polenta or farro. If serving with pasta, thin the cacciatore with a little pasta water before tossing with the noodles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/31/dining/as-lentils-cacciatore/merlin_171067620_0ec9e8ba-b68a-41ab-b7f4-e3bf409d4a12-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "bell pepper, capers, carrot, garlic, red lentils, red wine, rosemary, tomato paste, tomatoes, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch pieces", "1 red bell pepper, stems and seeds removed, thinly sliced lengthwise", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup capers, drained", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh rosemary or 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary", "1/2 cup red wine or stock (or 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar or sherry vinegar)", "1 (14-ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes", "3/4 cup red lentils (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat the oil over medium-high.
