{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet or Salty Lemonade", "description": "Sweetened, this is a classic all-American beverage for a hot summer's day. But add salt and it becomes a savory treat, much like the limeades served in the Middle East, India or Thailand. With or without salt, this recipe delivers. The proportions of water to juice, sugar and salt are completely a matter of taste, so adjust the recipe as you like. It works equally well with limes as it does with lemons.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/15/dining/15COOKING-LEMONADE2/15COOKING-LEMONADE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "lemon juice, lime juice, sugar, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 149}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 103, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup sugar", "1 cup freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice, pulp and rinds reserved (from about a dozen limes or lemons)", "2 teaspoons salt, or to taste (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan combine sugar with 1 cup water, and place over medium heat; cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In another pan bring 6 cups water to a boil; remove from heat, and add rinds and pulp.
