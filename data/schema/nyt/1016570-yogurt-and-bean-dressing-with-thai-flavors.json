{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yogurt and Bean Dressing With Thai Flavors", "description": "This version of Lisa Feldman\u2019s yogurt and bean dressing is based on her slightly sweet Thai ginger dressing. Sriracha sauce, I\u2019ve noticed, has become the go-to condiment for many chefs. It contributes just enough spice and pungency to the mix (you can add more if you want more heat). I like to serve this with grains, and as a dip or a dressing for crispy salads.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/10/science/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 cup, about (about 6 to 8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 67, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "150 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small garlic clove, halved, green shoot removed", "1/2 cup cooked white beans, drained and rinsed if using canned beans", "1/2 cup whole milk or 2 percent Greek yogurt or regular yogurt", "1 ice cube, if using Greek yogurt", "1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger", "1-2 teaspoons soy sauce, to taste", "1 teaspoon sriracha (more to taste)", "1 teaspoon brown sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon chopped cilantro", "1 tablespoon grape seed oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Process garlic in a food processor fitted with a steel blade until minced garlic is adhering to sides.
