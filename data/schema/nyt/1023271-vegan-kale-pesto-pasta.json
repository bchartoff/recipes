Thanks to a simple pot of water and good timing, it doesn\u2019t require soaking nuts for 30-plus minutes: Just boil the cashews with basil stems and kale stems (which are perfectly edible). Part of the way through, add the kale leaves, then right at the end of cooking, add a handful of basil leaves to lock in their color. Blend everything with garlic and red-pepper flakes, and watch in awe as rugged kale and cashews transform into a bright-green sauce that\u2019s as light as air. The 3 cups of sauce will keep for up to 3 days in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/17/dining/as-kale-pesto-pasta/as-kale-pesto-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "basil, cashew, kale, pasta, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 269}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 pound kale (about 2 bunches), leaves stripped and coarsely chopped, ribs and stems thinly sliced", "1 cup raw cashews", "1/2 cup basil leaves, stems reserved", "1 pound long or ridged noodles, like linguine or rigatoni", "1 large garlic clove, peeled", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
