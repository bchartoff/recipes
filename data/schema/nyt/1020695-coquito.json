{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coquito", "description": "Coquito, which means \u201clittle coconut\u201d in Spanish, is an eggnog-like mixture of coconut milk, eggs, sweetened condensed milk and rum or pitorro, a sort of moonshine rum. Coconut and rum cocktails are made throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, but coquito is unique to Puerto Rico. This recipe, which is adapted from the 1975 cookbook \u201cPuerto Rican Cookery\u201d by Carmen Aboy Valldejuli, was created by her husband, who tended bar during the couple\u2019s holiday parties at their home in San Juan. His recipe calls for shelling and pressing fresh coconuts to make your own coconut cream, but canned coconut cream makes an excellent substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/06/dining/dg-coquito/merlin_165082251_9ba48052-f792-4bf8-a482-cd73bfdb3171-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings (about 6 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "quick, cocktails", "keywords": "coconut, condensed milk, nutmeg, rum, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 147}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large fresh coconuts or 2 (14-ounce) cans unsweetened coconut cream (see Tip)", "4 egg yolks", "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "1 1/2 cups Puerto Rican rum (optional), preferably white rum (darker rum will affect the color of the coquito)", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Ground nutmeg, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using canned coconut cream, skip to Step 3. If using fresh coconuts, puncture one or two of the eyes of each coconut with a sharp knife or screwdriver; strain the coconut water into a bowl. Place coconuts on a stable surface, supported by a kitchen towel. Using a hammer, crack each coconut into 3 or 4 pieces. Slip a thin knife between the flesh and shell to separate it.
