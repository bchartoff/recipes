It's beef traditionally stuffed with vegetables, herbs, hard-cooked egg and seasonings. I cannot abide hard-boiled egg in cooked meat dishes, so I've substituted olives. It is often served as a kind of cold cut in Argentina, where it was created, but it can also be served hot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/10/01/dining/matambre/matambre-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "At least 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "steaks and chops", "keywords": "carrot, flank steak, green olives, watercress, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 259, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "417 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 flank steak, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon fresh marjoram or oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic", "1/2 bunch each chopped fresh parsley and cilantro leaves, or all of one or the other", "6 or 8 thin carrot sticks (1 medium carrot)", "1 cup pitted green olives", "1 medium red onion, sliced", "1 bunch watercress, trimmed", "2 tablespoons olive oil."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
