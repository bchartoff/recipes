{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Irish Oatmeal With Cream and Crunchy Sugar", "description": "A shower of heavy cream and plenty of caramelized Demerara sugar may make these Irish oats seem more like dessert than something you\u2019d serve first thing in the morning, but that\u2019s all the more reason to bake them up for a special occasion breakfast or brunch. Cardamom and cinnamon give them an especially earthy, perfumed aroma, and toasting the oats in butter before baking them lends nuttiness and depth. They\u2019re also extremely easy, and you can assemble the dish the night before, then bake them in the morning. Just add about 10 minutes to the baking time if you\u2019re starting them cold from the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/25/dining/20apperex3/merlin_166104195_4045c81d-9fb8-4a6a-bf71-cbea868ba894-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, grains and rice", "keywords": "demerara sugar, heavy cream, steel-cut oats, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 329}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups steel-cut oats", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "6 1/2 cups boiling water", "1/2 cup heavy cream, plus more for serving", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup Demerara sugar, plus more for serving", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
