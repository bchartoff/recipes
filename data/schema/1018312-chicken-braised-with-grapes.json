{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Braised With Grapes", "description": "This chicken casserole is simple to prepare, yet stunning and a trifle unusual to serve. The addition of whole clusters of seedless grapes elevates it from easy everyday to dinner-party material. I based it on two recipes: the memory of a chicken dish that I ate many years ago in Toulouse, France, and the classic poulet au vinaigre, or chicken in vinegar sauce. A mellow, aged sherry vinegar and a high-quality balsamic complement the grapes. I prefer a 15-year-old balsamic, which replaces the smidgen of tomato that is often included in poulet au vinaigre. One final tip: Be sure the grapes you select \u2014 and they can be black or green instead of red \u2014 are sweet and have green stems, an indication of freshness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28PAIR-WEB/28PAIR-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "balsamic vinegar, chicken, grapes, sherry vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 213}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 660, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "901 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pound chicken, cut in 10 pieces (breasts halved, backbone and wingtips removed)", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1 medium red onion, finely chopped", "2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup sherry vinegar, preferably Pedro Xim\u00e9nez", "1/4 cup chicken stock", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 pound seedless red grapes, cut into small clusters leaving stems attached", "3 sprigs fresh thyme", "1 tablespoon high-quality syrupy balsamic vinegar or pomegranate molasses"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken parts dry.
