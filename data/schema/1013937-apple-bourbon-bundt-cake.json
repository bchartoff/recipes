{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Bourbon Bundt Cake", "description": "One of my favorite pie alternatives is bundt cake. A hearty spice-filled bundt cake made from grated apples and toasted nuts, then soaked in whiskey syrup, defies the clich\u00e9 of Thanksgiving dessert, yet keeps well within its harvest-time paradigm. Plus, a bundt cake, which is really just like an oversize muffin baked in a fancy pan, is easy to whip up. The booze bath helps keep it fresh, meaning you can bake it ahead and eat the leftovers for days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/18/dining/18APPLEBUNDT/18APPLEBUNDT-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "apple, bourbon, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1295}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 565, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "379 milligrams", "sugarContent": "45 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sticks unsalted butter 226 grams, at room temperature, plus more to grease pan", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 315 grams, plus more to dust the pan", "3 tablespoons (30 grams) plus 1/2 cup (80 grams) bourbon or rye whiskey", "1/2 cup (90 grams) candied ginger, chopped", "1 3/4 cup (330 grams) light brown sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons (8 grams) baking powder", "1 teaspoon (5 grams) baking soda", "1 1/2 teaspoons (3 grams) ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon (5 grams) fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1 cup (227 grams) sour cream", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) vanilla extract", "1 1/2 teaspoon (5 grams) finely grated lemon zest", "2 medium Granny Smith apples about a pound, 454 grams, peeled, cored, and coarsely grated", "1 cup (120 grams) finely chopped, toasted pecans", "1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar", "Juice of 1/2 lemon (20 grams)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
