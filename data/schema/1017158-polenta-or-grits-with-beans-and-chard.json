I like to use a reddish bean for this \u2013 I have used a number of heirloom varieties from Rancho Gordo, but also regular supermarket pintos and red beans.  The recipe makes twice as much bean stew as you will need for 4 portions of polenta or grits. So make the polenta (or grits) again the next day and polish them off!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/24/science/recipehealthbeans/recipehealthbeans-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 153}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1214 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound (about 1 1/8 cups) dried pintos, red beans, borlottis or other similar heirloom beans, rinsed and picked over for stones", "5 cups water", "1 small onion, halved", "1 medium or large carrot, diced", "3 garlic cloves, 2 crushed, 1 minced", "A bouquet garni made with a couple of sprigs each parsley and thyme, a bay leaf and a Parmesan rind", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (more to taste)", "1 generous bunch Swiss chard (about 3/4 pound), stemmed, leaves washed in 2 changes water, and chopped (7 to 8 cups chopped greens)", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 cup <a href=\"http://www.ansonmills.com/products\">Anson Mills polenta or Pencil Cob grits, cooked</a>", "Freshly grated Parmesan or feta for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chop 1/2 of the onion and set aside.
