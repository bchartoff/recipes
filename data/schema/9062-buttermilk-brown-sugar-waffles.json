A cookware set? No. Better to buy pieces individually according to a couple's needs. A waffle iron? Why yes, if there's any chance of children. \n\nThese waffles are light, crisp and easy to throw together, like traditional waffles, but the buttermilk lends tang and the brown sugar an earthy sweetness. The secret ingredient here is wheat germ. It provides a lovely toothsome texture and crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20HIT_SUGARWAFFLE/20HIT_SUGARWAFFLE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 8 waffles", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, editors' pick, project", "keywords": "brown sugar, buttermilk, eggs, wheat germ, dessert, side dish, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 687}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 272, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "369 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 eggs", "1 3/4 cups buttermilk", "1 stick butter, melted and cooled to room temperature", "1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour or 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ", "2 tablespoons light brown sugar or 1 tablespoon each white and dark brown sugars", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon salt", "Nonstick cooking spray or butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk eggs, buttermilk and melted butter in a large bowl.
