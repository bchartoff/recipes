{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Heirloom Tomato Concass\u00e9 with Wilted Swiss Chard", "description": "Sweet, juicy heirloom tomatoes can be made into a concass\u00e9 that works as well with vegetables as it does with pasta or grains. Sometimes, I can\u2019t bear to cook sweet heirloom tomatoes. I love this concass\u00e9 with pasta or grains, but this time, I decided to use it as a sauce for Swiss chard. I steamed the chard to wilt it, heated it in a little bit of olive oil, then piled it on my plate and spooned the tomato sauce on top. It\u2019s a great combo, and now I think I\u2019ll use it as the vegetable and sauce element of a big bowl. A little feta sprinkled over the top would not be lost on this.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/22/science/23recipehealth/23recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, vegan, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 75, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "418 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh, sweet, ripe heirloom tomatoes, finely chopped (about 2 cups)", "1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced or pur\u00e9ed", "Salt to taste", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Several fresh basil leaves, cut in slivers or torn", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 or 2 bunches Swiss chard (about 1 1/4 to 2 pounds), stemmed (keep stems if they are wide and fleshy), leaves washed in 2 changes of water", "Feta for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the tomatoes with their juices, garlic, salt, vinegar, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and half the basil.
