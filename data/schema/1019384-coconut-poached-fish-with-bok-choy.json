The poaching liquid does double duty by gently cooking the fish and wilting the bok choy. If bok choy is unavailable, another sturdy green, like kale or Napa cabbage, can be substituted. Serve with steamed jasmine rice to soak up some of the fragrant coconut milk broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/colu-cod-horizontal/colu-cod-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, seafood", "keywords": "bok choy, cod, ginger, serrano chili, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 638}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 644, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "51 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "38 grams", "sodiumContent": "1077 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-ounce) cod fillets or other flaky white fish", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil", "1 large shallot, thinly sliced", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks", "1 fresh Thai or Serrano chile, thinly sliced", "2 (13 1/2-ounce) cans coconut milk", "1 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1 teaspoon light brown sugar", "About 7 ounces baby bok choy, ends trimmed and stalks\u00a0separated", "1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro, both leaves and tender stems", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallion greens", "Lime wedges (from 1 lime), for serving", "Flaky salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season fish well with salt.
