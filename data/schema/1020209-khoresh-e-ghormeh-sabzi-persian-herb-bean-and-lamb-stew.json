First, the sweet, pungent flavor of dried or fresh fenugreek leaves defines the stew, which simply isn\u2019t the same without it. Likewise, Omani limes (also known as dried Persian limes) add a distinct aged sourness that is vital to the dish. Finally, the classic Persian technique of saut\u00e9ing a mountain of finely minced herbs lends character and complexity to the foundation of the stew. Don\u2019t be afraid to really cook down the herbs until quite dark and dry; this step is essential to concentrate their flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14Iranianrex5/merlin_154113780_11be52fe-dc6f-4a25-8d88-66aaeb09f05b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "meat, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef, fenugreek, kidney bean, lamb shoulder, rice, saffron, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 162}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds lamb shoulder or beef chuck, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces", "1 heaping teaspoon ground turmeric", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup dried kidney beans", "3 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced", "1 pound Italian parsley (about 3 large bunches)", "1 pound cilantro (about 3 large bunches)", "2 bunches chives", "1 bunch scallions, roots trimmed", "1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves", "4 Omani (dried Persian) limes, rinsed and punctured multiple times with a fork", "1/4 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020207\">Polo Ba Tahdig</a> (Persian Rice With Bread Crust), for serving", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020213\">Mast-o Khiar</a>\u00a0or plain yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, season the meat with turmeric, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.

If the stew needs a little acidity, juice a lime into the stew through a sieve by pressing down on it with a spoon (avoid letting the seeds through the sieve, as they can be bitter). Set aside. Taste the stew and continue adding more lime juice until the stew is sufficiently tangy. Stir in the saffron. The stew should be a very deep, dark shade of green and quite thick when done.
