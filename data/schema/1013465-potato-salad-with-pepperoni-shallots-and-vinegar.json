{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato Salad With Pepperoni, Shallots and Vinegar", "description": "Here's a unique twist on the traditional German potato salad adapted from Torrisi Italian Specialties, a now shuttered Manhattan restaurant known for its nuanced approach to traditional Italian-American cuisine. Instead of bacon, this version calls for pepperoni, and shallots instead of onion or scallions. The finely chopped pepperoni is saut\u00e9ed with a generous pile of chopped shallots, dried oregano and fresh sage to which white wine vinegar is added to make a dressing that coats the potatoes in an addictive salty-spicy-tangy slurry. Don't skip the step that calls for boiling the potatoes with garlic cloves, thyme and peppercorns. It infuses the flesh of the potato with a subtle, herby flavor that's worth the extra effort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "gluten-free, pepperoni, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 312, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "524 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds small red-skinned potatoes, not peeled", "6 garlic cloves, peeled", "10 to 12 sprigs thyme", "1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns", "Salt", "1/4 cup olive oil", "6 sage leaves, fresh or dried", "1 tablespoon dried oregano", "8 ounces pepperoni, finely chopped or ground", "6 large shallots, peeled and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup white wine vinegar", "Ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat.
