But this quiche Lorraine is definitely not one of them. If you aren\u2019t in the mood to build \u2014 stone by stone \u2014 the most classic, tender, custardy, haunting quiche you\u2019ve ever had in your life, continue on and come back another day. If you\u2019re still here, it\u2019s just a matter of enjoying yourself as you take meticulous care with each ingredient, including the size and depth of the pan; each step, including the temperature changes of the oven; and each direction along the way. The downright platonic ideal of quiche that results is the fragrant, golden, encouraging reminder that, as with any endeavor, you only ever get out of it what you put into it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/magazine/25mag-eat-image1/25mag-eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pies and tarts", "keywords": "gruy\u00e8re, heavy cream, pancetta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 230}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup flour", "1 healthy pinch salt", "1 egg", "5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes the size of your thumbnail", "Ice water", "1 tablespoon butter, for the pan", "7 ounces pancetta, sliced into short matchsticks", "1 teaspoon grapeseed or neutral oil", "7 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, coarsely grated (about 2 cups)", "2 large eggs", "4 large yolks", "2 cups heavy cream", "Salt and pepper", "A nut of nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix flour and salt with a fork in a large bowl.
