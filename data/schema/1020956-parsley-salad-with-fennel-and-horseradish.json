This salad is an obvious nod to the Seder plate, including both parsley (bitter herbs) and fresh horseradish, except it\u2019s less ceremonial and more just a very delicious salad. I love, love parsley and think a well-seasoned bowl of it is something that most tables can benefit from, especially if those tables include braised pots of red meat. While parsley and fennel can be prepared ahead of time, the salad itself is best dressed right before you eat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/01Roman-Fennel-Salad-A/merlin_170265432_b307d88e-88a4-4a51-980e-81c3a2066536-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fennel, lemon juice, parsley, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 fennel bulbs, thinly sliced", "1 large bunch parsley, tender stems and leaves", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Olive oil, for drizzling", "Fresh horseradish, for grating"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss fennel and parsley together in a medium bowl.
