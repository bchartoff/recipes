How about warm cheese puffs studded with bacon\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or in this case, pancetta\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and fresh sage? They are salty, brawny and rich; crisp on the outside and soft within. Goug\u00e8res are best baked just before serving, but if you like you can make the batter ahead, form it into balls, and freeze them, unbaked.
