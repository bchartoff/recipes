{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffed and Seared Duck Breasts", "description": "Porchetta, a classic Italian pork dish, relies on a huge piece of meat (often the entire torso of a pig) and an incredibly aromatic combination of flavors \u2014 traditionally garlic, rosemary and fennel. It is fantastic, but it\u2019s not simple, and it\u2019s not fast. Indeed, one could argue that it\u2019s easier to get to Siena, where I last ate it, than to make it oneself. This dish addresses two challenges beautifully. First, it has some of the beauty of porchetta in a neat, manageable little package. Second, it converts the often-boring duck breast into a convenient, delicious piece of meat simply by stuffing it with garlic, rosemary, fennel and in this case, Parmesan. The result is delicious and, when sliced, quite impressive looking. Not porchetta, but not bad for a weeknight, either. And cheaper than going to Siena.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/07/dining/07COOKING-STUFFEDDUCKBREASTS1/07COOKING-STUFFEDDUCKBREASTS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "duck breast, fennel seeds, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 113}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 149, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "221 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 boneless duck breast halves", "2 to 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 teaspoons fennel seeds, crushed", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "Extra virgin olive oil, as needed", "Salt and black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees. Use a sharp knife to slice into each duck breast half at thickest part to create a pocket the entire length of breast, being sure not to poke through the other end (If you'd like, score the skin as shown in the photo.
