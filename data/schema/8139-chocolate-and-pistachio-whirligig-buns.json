The payoff for tackling one's fear, she argued, is big. Enter these pillowy, butter-rich buns dotted with semisweet chocolate and pistachios. They are not difficult \u2013 if you can follow directions, you can make them (really!) \u2013 and they are insanely delicious. You can also fill them with marmalade, or with honey and chopped walnuts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/22/dining/22COOKING-WHIRLIGIGBUNS2/22COOKING-WHIRLIGIGBUNS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "20 buns", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, breads", "keywords": "chocolate, pistachio, sugar, dessert, side dish, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 246}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 547, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "168 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 2/3 cups milk", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "5 to 5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the work surface", "1/3 cup sugar", "1 \u00bc teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 packets rapid-rise, bread-machine or other instant yeast", "2 large eggs", "Vegetable oil for bowl", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened to room temperature", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar", "3/4 cup shelled pistachios", "1 cup semisweet chocolate chips", "1 large egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, combine 8 tablespoons butter and the milk, and place over low heat until lukewarm, stirring to melt the butter.
