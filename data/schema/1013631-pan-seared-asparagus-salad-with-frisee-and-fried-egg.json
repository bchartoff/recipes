{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Seared Asparagus Salad With Fris\u00e9e and Fried Egg", "description": "Here is a fine variation on the old combination of egg and asparagus. It is a twist on the bistro staple, fris\u00e9e aux lardons, with pan-fried asparagus standing in for the bacon lardons. It\u2019s mixed with the fris\u00e9e and a pungent garlic vinaigrette laced with a little anchovy. Then, in place of the usual poached egg nestled in curling fris\u00e9e leaves, fry an egg until the edges are crisp and brown. This adds a vaguely baconlike nuance to the salad, without the meat.
