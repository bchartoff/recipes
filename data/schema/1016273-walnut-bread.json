{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Walnut Bread", "description": "The affinity of walnuts and whole wheat plays out well in this fairly simple loaf. I ramped up the walnut component by mixing in toasted pieces, including ground nuts along with the flour and even adding some walnut oil to the dough. Making this bread is straightforward enough for the home cook to master, and using a mere pinch of yeast will give the dough a nice rise. This dough would also welcome raisins, olives or pieces of figs along with the walnuts. I have found that the best way to introduce ingredients like these is to knead them in after the first rise.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/dining/23WALNUT_SPAN/23WALNUT-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "2 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, bread, walnut, walnut oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 127}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/3 cups/225 grams chopped walnuts", "2 teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1 packet)", "1 tablespoon/15 grams sea salt", "3 tablespoons/45 milliliters maple syrup", "4 tablespoons/60 milliliters walnut oil", "2 cups/250 grams whole-wheat flour", "3 cups/375 grams bread flour", "Coarse cornmeal, for dusting baking sheet"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toast walnuts in an oven or under the broiler.
