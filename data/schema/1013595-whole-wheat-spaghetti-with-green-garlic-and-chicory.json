{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Wheat Spaghetti With Green Garlic and Chicory", "description": "This dish is inspired by a classic oil and garlic pasta. I\u2019ve added chicory, a bitter green that is much loved in southern Italy but underused here. It\u2019s sold with lettuces in the supermarket, often called escarole or curly endive. Chicory contains a type of soluble fiber called inulin, which some studies suggest may have a positive effect on blood sugar levels.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/10/science/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "chicory, green garlic, whole wheat spaghetti, healthy, vegetarian, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head chicory (also sold as escarole and curly endive lettuce)", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons minced green garlic", "1 dried red pepper, broken in half, or 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "Salt to taste", "3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley", "3/4 pound whole-wheat spaghetti", "A generous amount of freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
