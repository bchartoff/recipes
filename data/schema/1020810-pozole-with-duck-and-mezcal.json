The hominy \u2014 soaked, then simmered using a quick-boil shortcut that skips the need for overnight soaking \u2014 welcome chiles and a good dose of cumin. This pozole includes prepared duck confit instead of the more usual pork or chicken. Some diced fresh pineapple in the thick stew balances the spicy heat. A small glass of mezcal is a fine partner, especially as a finishing touch. Save a little of the drink for when you and guests are almost finished eating, to pour into the bowl for the last soupy spoonfuls. It\u2019s what the French do in Gascony with their red wine when they enjoy a soup called garbure.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/dining/23pairrex/merlin_167526912_7593a1f5-b40f-49e7-9699-baccf26137c6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken stock, duck confit legs, mezcal, pineapple, white hominy, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dry white hominy (mote pelado)", "2 tablespoons duck fat or extra virgin olive oil", "1 large white onion, slivered", "1 green bell pepper, cored, seeded and slivered", "1 fresh poblano, cored, seeded and slivered", "1 leek, white part only, finely chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o, cored, seeded and minced", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder or smoked paprika", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne, or more, to taste", "1/4 whole fresh pineapple, peeled, cored and diced", "2 duck confit legs and thighs, boned and slivered", "4 cups chicken stock", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "Salt", "Red-pepper flakes, to taste", "2 teaspoons lime juice", "3 scallions, minced", "1 tablespoon minced cilantro leaves", "6 ounces mezcal, or to taste, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place hominy in a saucepan, add 4 cups water, bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes.
