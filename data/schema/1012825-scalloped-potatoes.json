They started growing Keuka Golds because the two best-known potatoes in the country \u2014 russets and Yukon Golds \u2014 did not grow well there. Keukas have yellow flesh, rich flavor and pale skin like Yukons, but they can handle the region\u2019s drastic temperature swings, short growing season, divergent soils and uneven rainfall. For this dish, Yukons work equally well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/19/dining/Scalloped-Keuka-Gold-Potatoes/Scalloped-Keuka-Gold-Potatoes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, winter, gluten-free, heavy cream, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 955}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons butter, more for greasing pie plate", "4 cloves garlic, minced", "1 medium leek, white and light green parts only, minced", "4 small cipollini onions, minced", "2 tablespoons minced French tarragon leaves plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped, for garnish", "3 cups heavy cream", "2 pounds (about 6 medium) Keuka Gold potatoes (unpeeled), sliced 1/8-inch thick", "Salt", "Ground white pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
