Here, the crustaceans rest on a bed of spicy sweet potatoes, in a dish that calls back to traditional feasts and community gatherings. The sassafras adds a grassy, slightly sour note, and the berries bring more color and tang. You can vary the shellfish depending on the season and your locale in this festive dish, which is easily doubled to serve a crowd.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sean Sherman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/dining/04NativeAmericanrex10/merlin_163486104_13bc6535-1da5-448b-989d-6dda6db64247-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "blackberries, crawfish, dandelion greens, file powder, jumbo shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 5}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon coarse sea salt, plus more as needed", "2 pounds crawfish", "1 pound head-on jumbo shrimp", "2 tablespoons sunflower oil", "1 cup chopped yellow onion", "1 small orange or purple sweet potato, unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons New Mexico red chile powder or chipotle chile powder", "1 tablespoon fil\u00e9 powder", "1/2 cup fresh or thawed frozen blackberries", "1/2 packed cup sliced dandelion greens (or other dark greens such as arugula or spinach), plus whole leaves reserved for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the red-pepper flakes, salt and\u00a03 quarts water\u00a0to a large pot.
