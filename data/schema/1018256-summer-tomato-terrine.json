{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Tomato Terrine", "description": "Some people might call my tomato terrine a tomato pudding, but it is more a salad, with very thin layers of highly seasoned tomato slices and bread. It's the perfect first course in summer. For this salad, the tomatoes have to be skinned. You can do this with a blowtorch, charring the skin until it can be slipped off, as we sometimes do, or you can blanch them in boiling water until the skins loosen and will easily slide off. Just don't put in more than two at a time, or the tomatoes will remain in the water so long that they will cook and turn mushy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michel Richard"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT8H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, brioche, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 303, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "866 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 1/2 pounds ripe field tomatoes (about 10 large ones)", "7 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "5 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 1/2 cups finely diced red onion", "7 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 unsliced loaf brioche, pain de mie or other fine-textured white bread", "1 1/2 cups minced Italian parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring large pot of water to boil.
