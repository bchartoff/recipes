These mallows are ideal in a cup of hot chocolate. Make them peppermint marshmallows by adding 2 teaspoons of peppermint extract. For festive swirls, add 10 drops of red food coloring at the end of Step 5, and use a toothpick to swirl the food coloring throughout the mixture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/18/dining/18COOKING-MARSHMALLOWS2/18COOKING-MARSHMALLOWS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "About 36 1 1/2-inch marshmallows", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "candies", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 69, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "37 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Neutral flavored oil, for greasing the baking dish", "3 envelopes/2 tablespoons, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons powdered unflavored gelatin", "1 1/2 cups/302 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup light corn syrup", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/51 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly oil an 8-by-8-inch baking dish.
