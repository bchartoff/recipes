{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grits Cakes With Country Ham and Bourbon Mayonnaise", "description": "As my friend Karen always says, \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to be a good party if the host is deep-frying something when you arrive.\u201d If you agree, consider serving these crisp-edged, golden grits cakes topped with bourbon mayonnaise and country ham at your next holiday shindig. These golden cubes, from the chef Kyle Knall at Maysville restaurant, can be prepared ahead of time, except for the frying part, which should be done within 20 minutes of serving. Southern country ham is worth seeking out, but if you can\u2019t find it and didn\u2019t have time to mail-order it ahead, you can substitute a good Serrano ham or prosciutto. Either way, it\u2019s party food at its best.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/25/dining/25TAKEAWAY_SPAN/25TAKEAWAY_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, country ham, grits", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 203, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "32 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 cup grapeseed oil, more for frying", "2 teaspoons bourbon", "1 teaspoon salt, more for mayonnaise", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, more for mayonnaise", "2 cups milk", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco", "1 cup coarse corn grits", "All-purpose flour, as needed", "Sliced country ham, torn into thin slivers, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the mayonnaise: In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolk, mustard and lemon juice.
