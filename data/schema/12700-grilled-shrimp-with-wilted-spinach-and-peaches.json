Toasting and then grinding the spices \u2014 peppercorns, coriander, mustard seeds and cardamom pods \u2014  used for the spice rub helps to even out their flavors so that they blend with the mild flavor of the shrimp. Serve them over fresh ripe peaches and tender spinach wilted by a hot mixture of ginger, vinegar, orange juice and curry powder.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby And Chris Schlesinger"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/05shrimp/05shrimp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday", "keywords": "dairy-free, main course, peach, shrimp, spinach, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 196}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "810 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon white peppercorns (you may substitute black)", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "1 tablespoon mustard seeds", "5 green cardamom pods", "1 pound 16- to 20-count (extra large) shrimp, peeled and deveined but tail left on", "Kosher salt and pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger", "1/4 cup red wine vinegar", "1/4 cup orange juice", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "2 ripe but firm peaches, diced medium", "1 pound spinach, washed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in your grill; when the coals are covered with gray ash and the temperature is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the coals for 3 to 4 seconds) you are ready to cook.
