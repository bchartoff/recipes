{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banana Almond Flax Smoothie", "description": "Flaxseeds are harder than sesame seeds, so it\u2019s a good idea to grind them \u2014 coarse or fine, depending on the recipe. That way, too, all the nutrition in flaxseeds is more readily available to the body. Keep what you don\u2019t use in the refrigerator or freezer, as the oils in flaxseeds, like those in most nuts and seeds, will oxidize if not kept cold. This substantial smoothie is perfect following a high-energy workout.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/30/health/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "One serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, shakes and smoothies", "keywords": "healthy", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 129}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 318, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "119 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium or large banana, preferably frozen, sliced", "2/3 cup buttermilk, yogurt or almond milk", "1 tablespoon roasted unsalted almond butter", "1 tablespoon flaxseeds", "1 teaspoon honey or agave nectar", "A couple of drops of almond extract or vanilla"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in a blender, along with a few ice cubes if the bananas have not been previously frozen.
