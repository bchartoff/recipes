{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pistachio and Rose Water Semolina Cake", "description": "Making this cake, which is adapted from \"Sweet,\" by Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh, is a labor of love, but that\u2019s only appropriate, for a cake adorned with rose petals. If you want to save time, however, you can do without the petals or use store-bought dried rose petals \u2014 the cake and cream are both special enough for those you feed to know you love them. If you are going all out with the roses, red or pink petals are a matter of preference; the red petals will turn a deep purple once candied. The cake keeps well for up to five days, but the petals should be sprinkled over just before serving. And don't confuse rose water and rose essence: the difference is huge. You want to use rose water here, and in brazen amounts, but it\u2019s what makes the cake both distinct and delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/20/dining/20BAKE4/20BAKE4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, pistachio, rose water, semolina flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 234}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large egg white", "About 40 medium pesticide-free red or pink rose petals (from about 2 roses)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 cup/150 grams shelled pistachios, plus 2 tablespoons, finely chopped, for serving", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 cup/100 grams almond meal", "3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons/170 grams fine semolina flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 1/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon/300 grams unsalted butter (2 1/2 sticks plus 1 tablespoon), at room temperature and cubed, plus extra for greasing the pan", "1 2/3 cups/330 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, lightly beaten", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon (about 1 teaspoon), plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice", "2 tablespoons rose water (not rose essence)", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/190 grams plain Greek yogurt", "3/4 cup/200 grams cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 tablespoon rose water", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters lemon juice", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters rose water", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit/100 degrees Celsius.
