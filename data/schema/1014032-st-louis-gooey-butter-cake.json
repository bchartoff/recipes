{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "St. Louis Gooey Butter Cake", "description": "Legend has it that the St. Louis gooey butter cake originated by accident in the 1930s, when a baker mixed up the proportion of butter in one of his coffee cakes. Rather than throw it out, he sold it by the square, and the sugary, sticky confection was a hit. Naturally, a slice of gooey cake ends up next to \u2014 or in place of \u2014 the pumpkin pie at many a Missourian\u2019s Thanksgiving table. Some bakers like to add pumpkin and spices to the gooey filling. Not so in this yeast-risen version from Molly Killeen, the St. Louis native behind Made by Molly, a dessert company in Brooklyn. Her recipe is soft-centered, crisp-edged and not too sweet. The leftovers are excellent for breakfast the next morning.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/10/dining/gooeybuttercake/gooeybuttercake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "16 to 20 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "cake, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1007}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 307, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "179 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons/45 milliliters milk at room temperature", "1 3/4 teaspoons/5 grams active dry yeast", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter at room temperature", "3 tablespoons/45 grams sugar", "1 teaspoon/5 grams kosher salt", "1 large egg", "1 3/4 cups/215 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon/50 milliliters light corn syrup", "2 1/2 teaspoons/10 milliliters vanilla extract", "12 tablespoons/170 grams/1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt", "1 large egg", "1 cup plus 3 tablespoons/145 grams all-purpose flour", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, mix milk with 2 tablespoons warm water.
