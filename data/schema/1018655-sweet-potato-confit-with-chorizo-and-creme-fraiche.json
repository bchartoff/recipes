{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Confit With Chorizo and Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche", "description": "Chefs have a way of taking the most humble ingredient and elevating it, which is what Andy Ticer and Michael Hudman of Hog & Hominy in Memphis did with sweet potatoes. The trick is to confit thick slices slow in fat, which transforms the texture into silk. They use pork fat at their restaurants, but home cooks can get a similar effect with olive oil seasoned with some bacon fat. It works well with olive oil alone, too. The chefs also make their own chorizo, and mix up their own cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche with heavy cream and buttermilk, then spike it with yuzu. Home cooks can make things more reasonable using pre-made chorizo and store-bought cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche with a hit of lemon juice (though yuzu is better if you can find it). The confit itself can be done a day or two ahead of time. Just lift the sweet potato slices from the oil and chill them. (To save a few minutes, you can toast the pecans in the oven as you bake the sweet potatoes.) A last note: It does seem like a daunting amount of olive oil, so a reasonably inexpensive brand will do. The leftover oil can be saved in the refrigerator to slick the bottom of the saut\u00e9 pan or round out a pasta sauce for future meals.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/15/dining/15CHEF2/15CHEF2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "chorizo, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, sweet potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 57}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (8-ounce) container cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "2 tablespoons lemon or yuzu juice", "2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 2 or 3)", "Kosher salt", "Ground black pepper", "About 3 cups olive oil, depending on the size of the baking dish", "1/2 cup bacon fat (optional)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 pound spicy fresh chorizo", "1/2 cup toasted pecans, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup mint leaves, torn"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, mix together cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and citrus juice and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble the dish.
