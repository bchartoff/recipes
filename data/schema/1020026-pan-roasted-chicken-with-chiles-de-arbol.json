It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</em>\nHere is a riff on a recipe from the Los Angeles chef Suzanne Goin, whose book \u201cSunday Suppers at Lucques\u201d is an exacting and delicious guide to restaurant cooking at home. Simply brown some chicken thighs in olive oil and butter over medium heat in an oven-safe skillet, adding lots of fresh thyme leaves and a couple of crumbled chiles de \u00e1rbol. Then apply a thin smear of mustard to each thigh, shower with buttered bread crumbs and transfer the pan to the broiler to crisp the chicken into succulence. Serve alongside or on top of a pile of baby greens lightly dressed in lemon juice and olive oil, with some bread to mop up the juices. That\u2019s fine.\n<em>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</em>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17norecipe-chicken-chiles/merlin_147762261_5174fd89-77a4-4df0-b9f8-786bf255c3c7-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "bread crumbs, chicken thigh, mustard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 97}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
