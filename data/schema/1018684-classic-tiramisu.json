{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Tiramis\u00f9", "description": "Done correctly, a classic tiramis\u00f9 can be transcendent. A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone, tiramis\u00f9 relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients. If you don\u2019t have a barista setup at home, pick up the espresso at a local coffee shop, or use strongly brewed coffee. As for the ladyfingers, make your own or buy them, but keep in mind that store-bought varieties can range from soft and spongy (like angel food cake) to hard and crunchy (like biscotti). Both kinds will work here, but if you're using the softer variety, stick to a light brushing of espresso, instead of a deep dip.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05COOKING-TIRAMISU1/05COOKING-TIRAMISU1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, custards and puddings", "keywords": "cocoa powder, cognac, espresso, ladyfingers, mascarpone, rum, dessert, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1044}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 381, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "166 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "1 cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)", "1 3/4 cups good espresso or very strong coffee", "2 tablespoons rum or cognac", "2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder", "About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)", "1 to 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume.
