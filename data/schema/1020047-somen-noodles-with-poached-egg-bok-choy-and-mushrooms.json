{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Somen Noodles With Poached Egg, Bok Choy and Mushrooms", "description": "The perfect salve for cold winter days, this vegetarian noodle soup can be cobbled together in an instant from the contents of a well-stocked kitchen. It takes its flavor from a quick bouillon using just four ingredients: soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions and shiitakes, which deliver a hefty, flavorful dose of glutamate. Poached eggs add richness to the clean and comforting broth. Fresh eggs have stronger, firmer albumen (egg whites) and will thus hold their shape better than older eggs, which have a tendency to unfurl. The main key to achieving that teardrop shape during poaching is allowing the eggs to simmer without disturbance until cooked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/dining/sl-somen-noodle-soup/merlin_150549918_35657d55-ee09-4a20-9a9f-467176c9e5fa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, quick, weeknight, soups and stews", "keywords": "bok choy, noodles, scallion, sesame oil, shiitake, soy sauce, fall, spring, winter, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 273}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 400, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1458 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "3 scallions, trimmed, whites and greens separated and thinly sliced", "8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded and caps thinly sliced (about 3 cups)", "Kosher salt", "1 medium bok choy (about 4 ounces), cut into bite-size pieces", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for serving", "2 bundles (about 7 ounces total) somen noodles, or any thin wheat or rice noodles", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat vegetable oil in a pot\u00a0over medium.
