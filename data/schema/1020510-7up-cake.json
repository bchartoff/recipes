{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "7Up Cake", "description": "I love a clandestine soda in the preparation of food, a flash of carbonation where the French might use wine, or brandy. It may be transgressive to say so, but I\u2019m hardly alone, for all those who cringe at the thought. Page through church or community cookbooks and you\u2019ll find examples: Coke-spiked Jell-O situations, root beer-glazed fillets of salmon, beans simmered in Moxie. This recipe for a lemon-and-lime soda cake came to me a while back from a Times reader who thought I\u2019d appreciate it (I did!). She said she\u2019d gotten it from a grandmother down south, who stored it on an index card placed in her copy of the cookbook published by the Symphony League of Jackson, Miss., in 1971. The original called for oleo and Crisco oil. I swapped these out for dairy and neutral oil, and a little less soda, and an additional 15 minutes in the oven. This leaves the cake toast-brown and glistening, glossy-crumbed and high-risen, a marvelous moist yellow within. I\u2019m no shill for Big Soda. You could just as easily make it with plain sparkling water and a spritz of lemon or lime. You could make it with sparkling wine!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/magazine/06mag-eat-cake/06mag-eat-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, cakes", "keywords": "7Up, soda, sugar, unsalted butter, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 610}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature, plus additional for greasing", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters vegetable, canola or other neutral oil", "3 cups/600 grams granulated sugar", "5 large eggs", "1 teaspoon lemon extract", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "1 cup/235 milliliters 7Up", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter, oil and sugar at medium speed.
