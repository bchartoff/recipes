{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Garlic Toast", "description": "Green garlic is harvested while still immature, before the bulb has a chance to fully develop the cloves we know so well. It looks a lot like a scallion, with a mild garlic flavor that\u2019s bright and fresh tasting. You can use both the white and green tender green parts of the stalk, trimming away any yellowing or woody parts near the top.\n\nIn this recipe, minced raw green garlic is mixed with butter, Parmesan and chives, then used to top toast. It\u2019s pungent, herbal and sweet with a bite from the chile flakes. Serve these plain, or top with any number of embellishments \u2013 sliced avocado, sliced tomatoes, dollops of ricotta cheese, fillets of anchovies or sardines. They make an excellent nibble with drinks, or serve a large portion with a salad for a light lunch. If you\u2019re not using it immediately, the green garlic butter will freeze well for up to 3 months. And the piquant butter can also be used to cook eggs, or tossed with asparagus, pasta or rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/26/multimedia/clark-garlic-crostini/clark-garlic-crostini-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, bread, green garlic, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 257}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 144, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "118 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Slices of crusty bread", "1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), softened", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan", "2 1/2 tablespoons chopped young green garlic stalks, white and green parts", "1 tablespoon minced chives", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste", "Large pinch red chile flakes", "1 regular (not green) garlic clove, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler.
