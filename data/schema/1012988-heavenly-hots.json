The recipe came from Bridge Creek Restaurant in Berkeley, Calif. A few tips: Don\u2019t cook the pancakes all the way through. You want the center to be a pocket of cream. The pancakes are so fragile that it may take a few tries to flip them. I used the thinnest, most flexible spatula I own, wedged it halfway under the pancake, letting the other half hang, then turned my wrist and gently laid it down on the other side. I recommend this over more aggressive flipping, which will tear the pancakes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/24/dining/24COOKING-HEAVENLY-HOTS2/24COOKING-HEAVENLY-HOTS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Makes 50 to 60 small pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner", "keywords": "eggs, sour cream, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "4 tablespoons cake flour", "2 cups sour cream", "3 tablespoons sugar", "Solid vegetable shortening for greasing griddle or skillet"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together all the ingredients except the vegetable shortening in a large bowl; beat until smooth.
