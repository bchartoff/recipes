{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Chicken Breast With Potatoes and Capers", "description": "Pan-seared chicken is a skill with countless rewards. (If this is your first time making chicken this way, you\u2019ll understand why fast.) You'll want to start the chicken on the stovetop and finish it in the oven. Then, once it's perfectly cooked, you can pair it with almost anything, whether a simple green salad or a side of smashed potatoes loaded with butter, mustard, capers and chopped lemon, as it is here. The trick is to steam, not boil, the potatoes, which gets them soft and smashable quickly. You need very little water (an inch or so), so there\u2019s no waiting around for water to boil, and, best of all, you won\u2019t lose any of that rich potato flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-chicken-breast-potatoes/sc-chicken-breast-potatoes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "capers, chicken breast, dijon mustard, potato, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 97}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 497, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "941 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skin-on chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "Black pepper", "1 1/2 pound small potatoes, washed and scrubbed (skin on), about 12 potatoes", "1 tablespoon canola oil", "1 lemon", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1 tablespoon capers, drained", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees with the oven rack in the center.
