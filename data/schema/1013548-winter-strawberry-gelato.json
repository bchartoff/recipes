{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Winter Strawberry Gelato", "description": "I\u2019m calling this \u201cwinter\u201d strawberry gelato only because I\u2019m making it with frozen organic strawberries. You can use sweet, fresh strawberries when they\u2019re in season. The recipe is inspired by Sherry Yard, a pastry chef who taught me that you can make perfectly wonderful ice cream with no cream and no eggs. I make this one with 2 percent milk, but you could use whole milk. If you\u2019re thinking of using skim milk, substitute water and make sorbet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/05/business/05recipehealth/05recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "Just under five cups, serving six to eight", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, gluten-free, healthy, vegetarian, milk, strawberry, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 35}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 104, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "64 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1-pound bag frozen strawberries; or 1 pound ripe, sweet strawberries, hulled", "1/2 cup sugar, preferably organic fair-trade sugar", "1/4 cup water", "2 cups milk (2 percent or whole)", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a 1-quart container and one smaller container \u2014 for any extra gelato \u2014 in the freezer.
