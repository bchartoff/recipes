Get wooden mallets. Prepare to eat for a while.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a crab pot, and most of us don\u2019t, fiddle with the largest stockpot or pasta boiler you have. Set a few clean, empty metal cans upside down on the bottom or invert a colander in there, anything that allows you to have a boiling liquid at the bottom and crabs above it, with none of them swimming around in the soup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/06/13/magazine/13food-span/13food-span-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 145, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "240 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces beer", "1 cup apple-cider vinegar", "1 dozen large blue crabs", "1/2 cup Chesapeake-style crab seasoning, preferably Old Bay"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a steamer pot or any large, heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid on the stove.
