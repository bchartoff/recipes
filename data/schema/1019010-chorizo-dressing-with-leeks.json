{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chorizo Dressing With Leeks", "description": "The better the bread you use here (a thick-crusted country loaf, sliced and toasted quite dry in the oven works well), the better the end result. It acts as a kind of canvas for the sweetness of the leeks and the dry, fragrant heat of the chorizo. You can make it well in advance of serving it alongside turkey, chicken or pork, at least as long as you leave time to reheat it in the oven, covered, with a few splashes of stock to moisten it. Just pull off the foil for the last few minutes to allow the top to crisp.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/26/dining/26COOKING-CHORIZO2/26COOKING-CHORIZO2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "bread, chorizo, turkey stock, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 183}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 398, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "682 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided", "1 (1 1/2-pound) loaf crusty bread, halved and sliced into thumb-thick slices", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large leeks, trimmed, cleaned and sliced into 1/4-inch half-moons (approximately 3 cups)", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "6 ounces dry (cured) chorizo, skin removed, quartered lengthwise and chopped", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon sweet (dulce) smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "3 to 4 cups chicken or turkey stock, divided"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
