{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Bread With Buckwheat and Seaweed", "description": "When in Brittany, eat oysters as the Bretons do: with Muscadet, brown bread and salted butter. It\u2019s a felicitous marriage of flavors that is impossible to shake, even after you leave Lorient or Concarneau. In the United States, you can improvise. Most restaurants serve only unsalted butter, so you have to do your own seasoning. Whole grain or brown bread often shows up in the basket.If you bake, you can make the bread yourself. Here is a brown bread at its most elemental, a yeast bread made with a thick batter that rises only once it is in a loaf pan and yields very nice, dense slices. I added slivers of kombu (kelp) for a briny touch and some buckwheat flour, typical of Brittany, to give the bread a nutty, slightly tart edge. It begs for butter. Salted.
