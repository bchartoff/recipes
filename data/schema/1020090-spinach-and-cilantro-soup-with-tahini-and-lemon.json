{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach-and-Cilantro Soup With Tahini and Lemon", "description": "The simplicity of this soup\u2019s technique belies its depth of flavor, which is both vivid and complex. The soup is made bright with lemon and fresh with cilantro, but the secret ingredient is tahini, which is layered into the soup to thicken it, and then drizzled generously on top in the form of a gently spiced sauce. The result is a soup that\u2019s both vegetal and creamy, tangy and rich. You\u2019ll find it so tasty that you\u2019ll forget you're drinking your vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/17/magazine/17mag-eat-slideshow-slide-SJ7U/17mag-eat-slideshow-slide-SJ7U-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "baby spinach, chicken stock, cilantro, tahini, healthy, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 653}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 70, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "242 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4\u00a0cup well-stirred tahini", "1/4\u00a0cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 large clove garlic, finely grated or pounded to a smooth paste", "3/4\u00a0teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2\u00a0teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2\u00a0teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "7 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade", "12 ounces baby spinach (about 12 packed cups)", "4 cups roughly chopped cilantro (from 2 large bunches)", "1/4\u00a0cup well-stirred tahini", "2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "First, make the sauce: Combine tahini, lemon juice, garlic, salt, cumin and red-pepper flakes with 2 tablespoons water in a medium bowl.
