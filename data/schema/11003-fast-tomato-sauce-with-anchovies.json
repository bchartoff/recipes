{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fast Tomato Sauce With Anchovies", "description": "Despite their reputation, anchovies are not overpowering, at least once cooked. Used with garlic as the start of a fast pasta sauce, they dissolve almost instantly and add a mysteriously meaty complexity that makes the sauce seem as if it had simmered for hours. Tossed with linguine and arugula, they make a simple dish sophisticated. If you're feeding a crowd, it doubles or triples beautifully.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/20/dining/20COOKING-FAST-ANCHOVIES/20COOKING-FAST-ANCHOVIES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "enough for 1 pound of pasta, about 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "anchovy, tomato, dairy-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 422}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 103, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "490 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "4 to 6 anchovy fillets, with some of their oil", "1 28-ounce can tomatoes, crushed or chopped and drained of their juice", "Salt and fresh-ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the olive oil in a deep skillet, and turn the heat to medium.
