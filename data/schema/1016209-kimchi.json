{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi", "description": "You don\u2019t need stoneware crocks or special jars to make kimchi. You do need a large bowl and multiple containers. When you become confident, you can add radishes and turnips, but this is the basic formula, from a book on preserving, \u201cTart and Sweet\u201d by Kelly Geary and Jessie Knadler. The carrots are not strictly traditional, but I particularly like their crunch. Some people like their kimchi \u201cnew,\u201d and some let it get really funky. Refrigerated and covered, it lasts indefinitely. I eat it many ways: finely chopped with steamed rice, fried eggs and Japanese sesame salt; stirred into chicken noodle soup; on steak, mixed with fresh watercress. In Korean food, it\u2019s ketchup, mustard and relish, all in one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/3019/03/22/dining/jm-kimchi/merlin_150934050_507fb4e7-4773-4be3-96eb-9eae98f7b9e6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, condiments, dips and spreads, project, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 298}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 138, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "2191 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 Napa cabbages, weighing 3 to 4 pounds total", "1/3 cup salt", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1/4 cup fish sauce", "1 1/2 cups Korean chili powder, also called gochugaru", "2 bunches of scallions, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup garlic, minced", "1/4 cup ginger, minced", "4 cups thin carrot sticks (optional), about 3 inches long"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the cabbages lengthwise into quarters, then across into thick ribbons.
