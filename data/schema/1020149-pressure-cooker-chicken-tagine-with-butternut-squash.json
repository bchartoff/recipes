{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Chicken Tagine With Butternut Squash", "description": "This warmly spiced stew is inspired by a Moroccan tagine. The word tagine describes both the clay pot traditionally used to cook the dish and the dish itself. This simplified version combines chicken with dates, which mostly disappear into the stew, imparting a honeyed sweetness. Butternut squash wedges steam on top as the chicken cooks, then get stirred in at the end, thickening the sauce.\n<p><em>Find a slow-cooker version of this recipe <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019698-slow-cooker-chicken-tagine-with-butternut-squash?action=click&module=RecipeBox&pgType=recipebox-page&region=all&rank=22\">here</a>.</em></p>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-chicken-tagine/sd-pressure-cooker-chicken-tagine-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 5 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken, cinnamon, cumin, dates, ginger, paprika, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 454}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 520, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1301 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons canola oil", "1 large red onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt", "1 (4-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced (about 1/4 cup)", "6 large garlic cloves, chopped", "1 cinnamon stick", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "3/4 teaspoon cumin", "1/2 teaspoon hot smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "Black pepper", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 cup chicken stock", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 1 large lemon), plus more to taste", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "8 dates, such as Medjool, pitted and halved", "1 (2- to 2 1/2-pound) butternut squash, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded and cut into 1-by-3-inch wedges", "1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped", "4 scallions, thinly sliced", "Cooked couscous or pita for serving (optional)", "Plain yogurt, for topping (optional)", "Toasted almonds, for topping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using the saut\u00e9 setting, warm the oil in the pot of a 6- to 8-quart pressure cooker.
