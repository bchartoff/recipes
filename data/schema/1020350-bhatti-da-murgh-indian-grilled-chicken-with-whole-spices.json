{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bhatti da Murgh (Indian Grilled Chicken With Whole Spices)", "description": "Adapted from the chef Chintan Pandya of Adda Indian Canteen in Long Island City, Queens, this fiery, aromatic recipe calls for marinating whole chicken legs in yogurt, ginger-garlic paste and ground spices, then coating them in cracked whole spices before roasting. The ground spices imbue the meat with flavor while the whole spices add pungency and a wonderful crunch. At Adda, Mr. Pandya cooks these in a tandoor. But you can roast them in your oven, or cook them on the grill using indirect heat and a baking sheet. In either case, brushing the sizzling chicken skin with plenty of melted butter is the key to its rich taste and burnished crispness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/24/dining/19apperex1/19apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "cardamom, chicken legs, garlic, ginger, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 174}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 whole, bone-in chicken legs (drumsticks with thighs attached, about 4 1/2 pounds)", "2 tablespoons finely grated garlic (about 6 large cloves)", "2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon white vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cayenne, or to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala", "2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1/2 cup plain whole milk yogurt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground clove", "1/2 teaspoon ground mace", "1/2 teaspoon ground anise or fennel seeds", "1/2 teaspoon ground black cardamom (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon ground green cardamom", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds", "2 teaspoons coriander seeds", "1 1/2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes", "3 to 4 tablespoons melted salted butter, as needed for basting", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pop the joint on each leg: Grasp a drumstick in one hand and a thigh in the other, and bend the joint back until you hear a crack.
