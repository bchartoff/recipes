But even at home, where you don\u2019t often go through two quarts of dressing a day, I\u2019m pretty certain a solid two cups will not go to waste. If I were you, I\u2019d start with sturdy lettuces, braised celery hearts, all the escaroles and chicories and hardy greens, then see what you think of it on all the crucifers, well boiled, drained and chilled.
