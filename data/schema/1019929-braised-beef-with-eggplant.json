{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Beef With Eggplant", "description": "The food of Provence usually evokes summer, with lovely vegetables, salads, seafood and a whiff of lavender. But there\u2019s a wintry side to it as well. When a fierce mistral wind blows, it\u2019s time to crank out beef stews and roasted meats. This braised beef dish, a pot roast, keeps a Proven\u00e7al flavor profile, with eggplant, garlic, fennel, rosemary, orange, black olives and tomatoes. It\u2019s prepared to allow the eggplant to maintain its character and not disintegrate. I like to braise a nice piece of tri-tip sirloin, but this recipe will suit any cut of beef you prefer for braising. Serve the dish with plain broad egg noodles dressed with a splash of good olive oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/dining/30pairrex1/merlin_149231790_c2dcd4e4-9d37-4626-95e5-28872aa010a0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "fall, winter, fennel, pastis, sun-dried tomato, tri-tip steak, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 366, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "913 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 eggplant (about 1 pound) in 1-inch dice", "Salt", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 2 1/2-pound piece of beef for braising (tri-tip, rump or brisket)", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh fennel bulb", "1/2 cup finely chopped red onion", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup chopped canned San Marzano tomatoes", "3 tablespoons pastis or other anise liqueur", "4 sun-dried tomatoes in oil, slivered", "1 cup dry red wine", "1 cup beef or vegetable stock", "Ground black pepper", "2 branches fresh rosemary", "2 branches fresh thyme", "1 teaspoon grated orange zest", "1 tablespoon black olive tapenade"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place eggplant in a colander, dust with salt and set aside 20 minutes.
