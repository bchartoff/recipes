Start them soaking the night before, then pop them in the oven in the morning for one of the most decadent brunches imaginable. Even better, you can <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016900-glazed-bacon\">bake a pan of bacon</a> at the same time. Just keep your eye on it; depending upon its thickness, the bacon might be done a few minutes sooner than the French toast. Then serve the French toast with more of the pan syrup spooned on top. But skip the maple syrup, which would be overkill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/16/multimedia/creme-brulee-toast/creme-brulee-toast-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch", "keywords": "challah bread, dark rum, eggs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 740}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 517, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "357 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 large eggs plus 2 yolks (or 6 whole eggs)", "2 1/4 cups whole milk", "1/2 cup heavy cream (or use more milk)", "3 tablespoons dark rum or orange juice", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 loaf challah bread, sliced 1 inch thick, preferably stale (about 1 pound)", "1 cup packed light brown sugar", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, cream, rum, vanilla, nutmeg and salt.
