{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lentil Salad With Roasted Vegetables", "description": "This lentil salad looks and tastes bright, thanks to a combination of tangerine juice, sherry vinegar and colorful caramelized roasted root vegetables. It works either as a main course, served with good bread and butter, or as side dish with roasted meat or fish. For the maximum visual impact, use both golden and red beets. Vegetarians can feel free to leave out the bacon. Leftovers will keep for at least five days, though try to pack it up without the radicchio, which gets soggy in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/06/multimedia/lentil-salad-clark/lentil-salad-clark-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "acorn squash, beets, carrot, lentils, radicchio, appetizer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 994}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small whole acorn squash, peeled if desired, halved, seeded and diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 medium carrots, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 medium celeriac, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "3 small beets, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 sprigs thyme", "1 sprig rosemary, cut in half", "4 slices (4 ounces) bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces (optional)", "2 cups brown or green lentils", "2 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 bay leaf", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup sherry vinegar, more to taste", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "2 heads radicchio, sliced", "2 scallions, thinly sliced (whites and greens)", "Parsley, roughly chopped, for garnish", "Flaky sea salt, to taste", "Cracked black pepper, to taste", "1 tangerine, halved and seeded"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
