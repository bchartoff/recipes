{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Roasted Chicken in Cream Sauce", "description": "This recipe is an adaptation of a dish the chef Angie Mar serves at the Beatrice Inn in Manhattan, the chicken crisped in a pan, then napped in a Madeira-laced cream sauce dotted with morels. Which sounds fancy and hard to make but isn't, really. Brown the chicken, and set it aside to rest. Cook the morels in the remaining fat \u2014 you could swap them out for another wild mushroom or even button mushrooms in a pinch \u2014 and then flash them with Cognac, which you'll find will come in handy again and again once you start cooking with it. (Try it on <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017319-simple-steak-au-poivre\">steak au poivre!</a>) Then build up a sauce with cream and a little butter and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for gloss, get the chicken into it and add some fresh savory and tarragon at the end \u2014 or just one of those, or neither. Make the dish as you prefer or as you can. It's luxurious, every time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/06/magazine/06mag-eat/06mag-06eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "chicken, cognac, cream, madeira, morels, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 732}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 chicken, 4 to 4 1/2 pounds, cut into pieces, or some combination of chicken parts on or off the bone, approximately 3 pounds", "Kosher salt to taste", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "12 to 15 morels or other wild mushrooms, approximately 3 1/2 ounces", "1/4 cup Cognac", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium", "2/3 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup Madeira wine", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or Greek-style yogurt", "2 teaspoons finely chopped savory", "1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon", "1/2 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, to finish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the chicken parts aggressively with salt.
