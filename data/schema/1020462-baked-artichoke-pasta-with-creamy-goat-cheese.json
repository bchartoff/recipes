{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Artichoke Pasta With Creamy Goat Cheese", "description": "This cheese-filled pasta bake gets its sweet and crunchy topping from a layer of canned fried onions and Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Canned artichokes give it a savory depth, while a combination of goat cheese, cream cheese and mozzarella make it wonderfully gooey. Make sure to use plain \u2014 not marinated \u2014 artichokes, which will be too sharp and acidic here. You\u2019re looking for a mellow richness in this comforting casserole.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/20canrex1/merlin_160763187_bd4b82e1-8ff7-4614-ae45-1c4cf4c92a76-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, cream cheese, fried onions, goat cheese, mozzarella, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 734}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt, as needed", "1 pound fusilli, farfalle or other short pasta", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 large bunch scallions, thinly sliced, whites and greens separated", "4 fat garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "8 ounces cream cheese (1 cup), cubed", "6 ounces goat cheese, cubed", "2 (14-ounce) cans artichoke hearts (not marinated), drained and cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 cups canned fried onions", "6 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese (1 1/2 cups)", "1 cup chopped parsley", "1 cup chopped fresh dill", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees and bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.
