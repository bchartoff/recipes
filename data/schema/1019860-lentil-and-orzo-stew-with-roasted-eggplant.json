{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lentil and Orzo Stew With Roasted Eggplant", "description": "For rich, golden cubes of roasted eggplant, a high-temperature oven is crucial. Here, lentils and pasta make for a hearty stew, and the coriander seeds introduce a robust, clean flavor. Use a mortar and pestle, a spice grinder or the base of a wine bottle to crush the seeds, opening them up before they\u2019re tossed with the eggplant. Serve this stew warm or hot, topped with an aged, salty cheese like ricotta salata or feta, and a soft-poached egg if you like. The lemon zest and juice are essential and enhance the finish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/18/dining/YK-orzo-and-lentils/YK-orzo-and-lentils-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "coriander, eggplant, lentils, orzo, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 782}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 608, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "13 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1472 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds eggplant (2 small or 1 large, skin on, or peeled, if desired), chopped into 1-inch pieces", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds, crushed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 medium carrot, finely chopped", "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped", "2 celery stalks, finely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 cup dried lentils (green, black or brown)", "5 cups chicken or vegetable stock, or water", "1/2 cup orzo or other small pasta, such as ditalini, stelline or macaroni", "Zest and juice from 1 lemon, plus 4 lemon wedges for garnish", "1/4 cup shaved ricotta salata or crumbled feta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
