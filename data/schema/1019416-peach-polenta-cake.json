{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach Polenta Cake", "description": "This simple, summery cake gets its rustic texture from polenta and ground almonds. Most of its sweetness comes from cut peaches that bubble in a light caramel at the bottom of the cake, then decorate the top when you flip it over. The recipe is from King, a small restaurant in Manhattan where the chefs Clare de Boer and Jess Shadbolt swap the stone fruit out to use whatever is sweet, juicy and in season. Try the cake with peaches, nectarines, plums or even a mix of all three, but make sure to give the cake the time it needs to turn golden brown and firm to the touch. At King, the chefs use the Italian brand Moretti's stone-ground polenta bramata. For a more rustic cake, with a little bite, use coarse polenta. For a more tender crumb, use finely ground polenta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/dining/18kingrex/merlin_141364617_9f8d921a-c77c-461e-8ea0-23f543d520c8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "12 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almond, peach, polenta, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 337}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 751, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "77 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "136 milligrams", "sugarContent": "47 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups/470 grams sugar", "2 sticks plus 6 tablespoons/305 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "6 to 8 peeled, pitted and halved peaches, nectarines or plums, or use a mix", "1 1/2 cups/230 grams slivered almonds", "1 scant cup/230 grams polenta, or cornmeal (see note)", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/70 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "Zest of 1 lemon", "4 eggs", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, to serve (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.
