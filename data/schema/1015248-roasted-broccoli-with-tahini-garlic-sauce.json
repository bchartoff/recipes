{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Broccoli With Tahini Garlic Sauce", "description": "One of my favorite Middle Eastern mezze is deep-fried cauliflower served with tahini garlic sauce. I decided to try the dish with broccoli, but instead of deep-frying the broccoli I roasted it, a method that requires a lot less oil. The buds on the broccoli florets toast to a crispy brown, and the texture of the stalk remains crisp. It goes wonderfully with the classic and irresistible tahini garlic sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/22/science/23recipehealth/23recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 743}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 155, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "310 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 garlic clove, cut in half, green shoots removed", "Salt to taste", "1/3 cup sesame tahini", "2 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (more to taste)", "1/3 cup water", "Aleppo pepper or red pepper flakes for sprinkling", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds broccoli crowns", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mortar and pestle mash the garlic clove to a pur\u00e9e with a generous pinch of salt.
