{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Grain Blueberry Muffins With Orange Streusel", "description": "This master recipe for juicy, whole grain berry muffins is both extremely flexible and extremely rewarding. It is sweet but not sugary, packed with whole grains but not dense, and reasonably rich in fiber, protein, complex carbohydrates and healthy fats.\u00a0The fresh berries and nuts are interchangeable with dried fruit, coconut or sunflower seeds. And the muffins freeze beautifully; they can go from a 300-degree oven to the breakfast table (or the car) in about 20 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/24/dining/24FASTMUFFIN/24FASTMUFFIN-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "18 to 24 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, quick breads", "keywords": "blueberry, carrot, maple syrup, oats, pecan, walnut, whole wheat flour, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 462}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 288, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "240 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/240 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed", "2/3 cup/75 grams whole wheat flour or wheat germ, preferably toasted", "2/3 cup/92 grams fine-ground yellow cornmeal", "2/3 cup/66 grams rolled oats (not quick-cooking)", "2/3 cup/142 grams packed light brown sugar", "4 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "2 teaspoons cinnamon", "2 teaspoons nutmeg or allspice (or use additional cinnamon)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 3/4 cups/414 milliliters buttermilk, more as needed", "1 1/3 cup/315 milliliters coconut oil, or neutral oil like safflower or canola", "2/3 cup/158 milliliters maple syrup", "4 eggs", "2 cups/198 grams grated carrots or tart apple", "1 1/2 cups/255 grams blueberries", "1 cup/113 grams chopped toasted walnuts or pecans (optional)", "1/3 cup/71 grams packed light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/4 cup/59 milliliters coconut oil or cold unsalted butter", "1/2 cup/60 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 tablespoons finely grated orange zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the muffins: In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flours, cornmeal, oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, mix the wet ingredients: buttermilk, oil, maple syrup and eggs.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and gently mix just until blended.
