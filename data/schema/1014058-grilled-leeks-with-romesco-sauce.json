{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Leeks With Romesco Sauce", "description": "In Catalonia there is an annual ritual called the cal\u00e7otada, an outdoor barbecue that revolves around local spring onions called cal\u00e7ots. After harvest, the onions, which look like baby leeks, are grilled, then wrapped in newspapers to steam for a bit. They\u2019re served with romesco sauce, the nut-thickened pepper pur\u00e9e that is another regional specialty. For this picnic recipe, I\u2019ve substituted leeks for the spring onions and reversed the process, steaming the leeks at home, then finishing them on a wood fire to get the smoky flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/grilled-leeks-romesco-sauce/grilled-leeks-romesco-sauce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, healthy, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 219, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "250 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium red pepper, roasted, peeled, seeds and membranes removed", "6 ounces tomatoes (1 large or 2 roma)", "1 thick slice (about 1 ounce) baguette or country-style bread, lightly toasted", "1 large garlic clove, peeled", "1/4 cup toasted almonds, or a combination of almonds and skinned roasted hazelnuts", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon pure ground chili powder or red pepper flakes, to taste pepper flakes are hotter", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh Italian parsley", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika or Spanish smoked paprika (piment\u00f3n)", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, as needed", "6 fat leeks, or 12 baby leeks", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the romesco sauce.
