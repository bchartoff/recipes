{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Macarons", "description": "Filled with ground almonds and flavored with vanilla beans, these classic French macarons are soft in the center, with a crunchy meringue shell that shatters gloriously when you bite. Buttercream is the most traditional macaron filling, but you can substitute jam, chocolate ganache, dulce de leche or lemon curd. And feel free to play with the flavorings: Instead of vanilla, try a dash of rose water, some grated lemon zest or ground cinnamon. If you want to tint the macarons, add a drop or two of food coloring to the batter. These are best made a day or two in advance, and will last for up to 5 days stored airtight at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/dining/mc-macarons/mc-macarons-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 30 small macarons", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "almond flour, butter, confectioners' sugar, cream of tartar, egg whites, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla bean, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 99}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/65 grams blanched almond flour", "1/2 cup/65 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 large egg whites (60 grams), at room temperature", "1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "4 tablespoons/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 vanilla bean, scraped", "2 large egg yolks", "1/4 cup/50 grams superfine sugar", "1 tablespoon water, brandy or rum", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons/155 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, at room temperature", "3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
