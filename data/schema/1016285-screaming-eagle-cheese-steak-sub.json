{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Screaming Eagle Cheese-Steak Sub", "description": "Every college has one: some kind of nasty-fantastic amalgam of cheese and meat and grease and bread and salt and melting awesomeness. From freshman year to graduation, you can eat these things twice a week and it will hurt you, but not badly \u2014 that is the magic of youth and appetite and America combined. After that, such a sandwich must be counted a special treat, and adapted to adult use. For this cheese steak sandwich, a version of the Screaming Eagle served in the dining halls of Boston College, the Jesuit university in Chestnut Hill, Mass., I made two essential changes: I used Cheddar in place of the usual white American the college uses; and I replaced the thin-shaved steak that is a hallmark of cheese steaks the world over with skirt steak. Doing so recalled Corinthians. When you are a child, American cheese and shaved steak can count as ambrosia. As an adult, it's kind of nasty. But skirt steak? Melting Cheddar? That is actually ambrosial. The fiery mayonnaise does the rest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/27/magazine/mag-27Eat-t-000_CA0/mag-27Eat-t-000_CA0-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 412}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 975, "unsaturatedFatContent": "41 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "68 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "1316 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup mayonnaise", "3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced, or more to taste", "2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil, like canola", "1 large white onion, peeled and sliced thin", "2 red bell peppers, seeded and sliced thin", "1 green bell pepper, seeded and sliced thin", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 pound button mushrooms, cleaned and sliced thin", "2 1/2 pounds skirt steak, cut into 6 equal-size sections", "6 large sub rolls or Italian bread cut into 6 submarine-shaped pieces of 8 to 10 inches, sliced down the center", "1/2 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, sliced thin"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make chipotle mayonnaise: Combine mayonnaise and minced peppers in a small bowl and stir well.
