In the words of Jared Austin, a Mississippi riverboat pilot and seafood-boil master, \u2018\u2018Nothing about any of this is subtle \u2014 people standing around the pot should sneeze and cough.\u2019\u2019 The key to a successful shrimp boil is layering ingredients into the pot so that everything is done cooking at once: First add the potatoes and sausage, then the shrimp, then the frozen corn to bring the temperature down and prevent overcooking. Let it all soak to absorb the salt and spice, then dump it out onto the table and eat with copious amounts of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019531-remoulade\">r\u00e9moulade</a>. While this recipe can easily be halved, it\u2019s a simple \u2014 and extraordinarily fun \u2014 way to feed a crowd. Just remember to heed Austin\u2019s advice: \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t be afraid of cayenne.
