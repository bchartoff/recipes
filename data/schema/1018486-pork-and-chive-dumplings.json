{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork-and-Chive Dumplings", "description": "This recipe for pork-and-chive dumplings comes from the chef Helen You, who learned to make dumplings from her mother in Tianjin, China. She serves these classic boiled dumplings, along with 100 other varieties, at her restaurant, Dumpling Galaxy, in Flushing, Queens. The filling is a simple mix of ground pork, seasoned with grated ginger, soy and garlic chives, and it works best with slightly fatty ground meat (about 30 percent fat, if your butcher asks). It's traditional to splash the meat with shaoxing, the Chinese rice wine, but You prefers to use sherry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/dining/tr-pork-chive-dumplings/merlin_149284194_955b9059-e6d6-43d1-99c9-3a257107cdd8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "24 dumplings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, dumplings", "keywords": "chives, pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 262}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 91, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "86 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup lukewarm water", "1 egg white", "1 pound ground pork", "2 tablespoons sherry", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 ounces finely chopped garlic chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To begin the dough, put the flour and salt in a large bowl. Use your fingers to stir in the water and egg white, until the dough comes together as a shaggy ball. Move the dough to a flour-dusted work surface, and knead it, dusting with more flour to keep it from sticking, until it is smooth to the touch, with no cracks or pockets of flour. Cover the dough, and let it rest at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Knead the dough about 10 times, or until it forms a firm ball as smooth as satin. Use a dough scraper or a flour-dusted knife to cut it into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a log, and cut it into 6 equal pieces (for a total of 24 small pieces). Flatten the pieces with your hands, and roll each one into a 3-to-4-inch round wrapper. As you work, cover the dough with a lightly moistened towel to keep it from drying out."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To prepare the filling, place the ingredients in a mixing bowl, and use your hands to combine them until they are well blended. Place a rounded tablespoon of the filling at the center of each wrapper, and gently squeeze the edges shut. As you work, push out any air bubbles and fix any tears. When ready to eat, bring a large pot of water to boil. Boil the dumplings 6 at a time, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they float to the surface and the wrappers turn puffy and translucent. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate and serve immediately."}]}
