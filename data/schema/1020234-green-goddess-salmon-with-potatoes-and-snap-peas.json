{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Goddess Salmon With Potatoes and Snap Peas", "description": "A sheet pan and a broiler are the secret to many easy weeknight meals. In this particularly vibrant dish, they impart a complex grill-like flavor to salmon and potatoes, which are broiled simultaneously on the same sheet pan. While they cook, you\u2019ll blend together a lively green goddess dressing of fresh herbs, yogurt, mayonnaise, garlic and anchovies. When the oven timer chimes, toss the roasted potatoes with raw cucumbers and snap peas. Serve alongside the just-flaky salmon and dollop with the verdant dressing. The crunchy vegetables, warm potatoes, tender fish and creamy dressing make for an unexpected though delightful combination. (For the dressing, tarragon, dill, parsley or cilantro will provide a familiar flavor to this classic sauce, but mint or arugula will work, too.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/dining/sc-green-goddess-salmon/merlin_154348170_27889e9f-9ca7-4615-adea-770d38d64e99-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, vegetables", "keywords": "herbs, mayonnaise, new potato, potato, salmon, snap peas, yogurt, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 365}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds small new or baby potatoes, halved or quartered if large", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1 (1 1/2-pound) piece skin-on center-cut salmon", "1 packed cup parsley leaves", "1 packed cup mixed herbs, such as chives, mint, dill, basil or cilantro, plus a few sprigs of dill, for garnish", "2 anchovy fillets", "1 to 2 garlic\u00a0cloves", "1 lemon, zested and halved", "1/2 cup whole-milk yogurt", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "8 ounces snap peas, trimmed and halved on the bias (about 2 cups)", "4 small cucumbers, halved lengthwise and cut on the bias into 1-inch pieces (about 1 \u00bc pounds)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler to high with the rack about 6 inches from the broiler.
