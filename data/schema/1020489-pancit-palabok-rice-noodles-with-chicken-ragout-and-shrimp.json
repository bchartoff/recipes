Among our many pancit dishes, palabok is the richest. The sauce almost takes on the texture of an Italian rag\u00f9, with the meat slowly disintegrating into a thick gravy that\u2019s stained reddish-gold by achuete (annatto). The toppings aren\u2019t decorative, but a crucial part of the dish: a whole regiment of hard-boiled eggs and poached shrimp, plus a tumble of fried garlic and crumbled chicharron (puffed-up crispy pork skins).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Angela Dimayuga"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex8-pansit/merlin_160617849_c6545d58-d251-4ebc-8ebe-592849e14481-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, grains and rice, noodles, poultry, seafood", "keywords": "annatto powder, banana leaves, calamansi, chicharron, chicken, rice vermicelli noodles, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 59}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds bone-in, skin-on split chicken breasts (about 2 breasts)", "2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "Kosher salt", "1 pound small shrimp (26/30 count), peeled and deveined", "6 eggs", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola", "3 tablespoons achuete annatto powder (3/4 ounce)", "2 large yellow onions, finely minced (about 3 1/2 cups)", "8 celery stalks, finely minced (about 3 cups)", "15 garlic cloves, finely minced", "Fish sauce, as needed", "1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, plus more for garnish", "Banana leaves, for lining the serving dish (optional)", "16 to 18 ounces rice vermicelli noodles (ideally about the thickness of spaghetti, or whatever you can find!), cooked", "1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced", "3 calamansi, halved, or lemons, cut into wedges, seeds removed", "1 cup chicharron, crushed into small pieces", "A few tablespoons of crushed fried garlic"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the chicken breasts and thighs to a large pot.
