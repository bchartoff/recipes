{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cumin Lamb Meatballs With Tahini Yogurt Dipping Sauce", "description": "Meatballs are not the kind of thing one would usually think of as quick-and-easy-dinner fare. All that rolling and frying can take forever, making meatballs a weekend project for a leisurely afternoon. There are, however, shortcuts \u2014 if you can suppress your perfectionist urges.\n\nYou can use this recipe as a template for whatever kind of ground meat you like. Lamb is earthy and works well with the creamy tahini sauce, reminiscent of a carnivore\u2019s falafel. But beef, turkey, veal or pork are good substitutes. And all will make equally good blobs and none will be a project. Just a fast and filling dinner any night of the week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/24/dining/dj-dinner/dj-dinner-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "cumin seeds, lamb, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 779}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 448, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "363 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/4 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, plus a pinch", "1 pound ground lamb", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds", "1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, more for serving", "Black pepper, to taste", "1/2 teaspoon chile powder", "1 scallion, minced", "2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley", "Olive oil, for greasing pan", "1/4 cup plain yogurt", "1/4 cup tahini", "Fresh lemon juice, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat broiler with an oven rack placed 3 inches below heat source."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a knife, make a paste with garlic and a pinch of salt.
