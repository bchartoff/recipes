{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Peach Salad With Simple Lime Dressing", "description": "Eddie Hernandez, who runs a string of Mexican restaurants in Georgia and Tennessee called Taqueria del Sol, came up with a delicious way to deal with hard, unripe peaches. Sliced thinly, softened with salt and brightened with lime juice and Serrano chiles, the peaches become a salad that\u2019s a cousin to Mexican street snacks built from unripe mangoes and papayas and punched up with chile salt. The salad keeps well in the refrigerator for several days. Mr. Hernandez likes to eat it with a scoop of cottage cheese on the side, though dabs of goat cheese would do as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/dining/11turniprex2/11turniprex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican, southern", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "fall, healthy, high fiber, raw, vegan, vegetarian, lime, peach, serrano chili, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 56}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 281, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "235 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup vegetable oil", "1/4 cup lime juice", "1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt", "2 cups thinly sliced unripe peaches", "2 to 3 finely chopped Serrano chiles (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk the oil, lime juice and salt until emulsified.
