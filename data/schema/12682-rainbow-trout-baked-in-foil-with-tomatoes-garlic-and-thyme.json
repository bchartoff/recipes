It\u2019s a great dish to make when you don\u2019t know exactly when guests are going to arrive, as everything can be prepared in advance and the fish can be baked at the last minute. I\u2019ve adapted Christine\u2019s salmon recipe to rainbow trout, which are farmed in a sustainable way and less expensive than wild salmon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/14/science/15recipehealth/15recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, low-sodium, nut-free, main course, summer, tomato, trout", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 238}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 595, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "69 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1093 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Extra virgin olive oil for the foil", "4 small rainbow trout, boned", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 pound ripe tomatoes in season, peeled, seeded and chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "4 to 8 sprigs fresh thyme", "Chopped fresh parsley or thyme for garnish", "Lemon wedges for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
