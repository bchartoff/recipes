{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Alfajores \u00a0", "description": "Popular all over Latin America, dulce de leche confections called alfajores come in many varieties. In this popular version, delicate, crumbly butter cookies are sandwiched with a thick layer of dulce de leche before being rolled in coconut. They are petite yet decadent morsels that go particularly well with strong black coffee to cut their creamy richness. You can make the dulce de leche a week ahead (store it in the refrigerator) and the cookies 5 days ahead (store them in an airtight container at room temperature). Once sandwiched together, the cookies will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for 3 days, but are best eaten within 24 hours of filling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/01/dining/01ALFAJORES/01ALFAJORES-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "About 50 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "coconut, cornstarch, sweetened condensed milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 229}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 125, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "35 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (13.4-ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk, labels removed", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters brandy", "1 teaspoon/2 grams finely grated lemon zest", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon/165 grams cornstarch", "1 teaspoon/5 grams baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon/1 gram baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams fine sea salt, plus a pinch for dulce de leche", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "10 tablespoons/141 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 large egg yolks", "1 cup/100 grams finely ground dried coconut"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dulce de leche: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then carefully lower condensed milk cans on their sides into the water.
