(The dish is sometimes spelled laab, lob or lop.) It's perfect hot weather food: spicy, crunchy and light, but rich in flavors and contrasts. Traditionally, this dish is made with a roasted rice powder that's prepared by toasting raw rice in a wok, then grounding it to a powder, but you can find premade roasted rice powder at Asian markets. Whatever you do, don't skip it \u2014 it adds a nuttiness that's essential to the authentic flavor of the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/11/dining/larb/larb-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "chicken, mint, rice, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 220}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 199, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "375 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup raw sticky rice (see Note) or 2 tablespoons roasted rice powder (available at Asian markets)", "16 ounces coarsely ground or finely chopped white- or dark-meat chicken (lean beef, such as sirloin, can be substituted)", "1/2 teaspoon hot chile powder, preferably Thai or Lao", "4 teaspoons fish sauce (nam pla)", "5 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice", "1/4 cup slivered red onions", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro", "2 tablespoons sliced scallions", "10 whole mint leaves, more for serving", "Lettuce leaves", "cucumber spears, for serving", "4 cups cooked sticky or jasmine rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make roasted rice powder, heat a wok or skillet over high heat.
