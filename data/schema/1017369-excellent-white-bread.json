{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Excellent White Bread", "description": "This straightforward loaf is the white bread of your dreams, and its fluffy slices make for evenly browned toast. The 1/3-cup of sugar makes this mildly sweet and perfect for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but you can cut it down to 2 tablespoons if you\u2019d rather have something more neutral in flavor. You do need some sugar, however, to feed the yeast and ensure a lofty rise. This recipe makes two loaves, one for now, and one for the freezer or to share with a lucky friend.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/30/dining/29BIGAPPETITE/29BIGAPPETITE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H15M", "recipeYield": "2 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, breads", "keywords": "active dry yeast, butter, egg, milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1179}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 275, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "237 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1 package)", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters lukewarm milk", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon/15 grams kosher salt", "3 tablespoons/43 grams butter, melted, more for greasing bowl and pans and for brushing the tops of the loaves", "2 eggs", "5 to 6 cups/625 grams to 750 grams all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large electric mixer bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm milk.
