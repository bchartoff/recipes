{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Wilted Greens, Bacon and Fried Egg", "description": "The success of this delectably simple weeknight pasta relies on two things: the quality of the bacon, and the sheer amount of freshly ground pepper. The bacon must have ample fat to render out (this is where the sauciness comes from) as well as a hearty, smoky flavor. As for the black pepper, more is more; getting enough of that subtle, floral spiciness will require more than a few turns from the grinder. And yes, there's an egg on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/dining/pasta-with-bacon-and-wilted-greens/pasta-with-bacon-and-wilted-greens-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas", "keywords": "bacon, kale, rigatoni, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 349}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 663, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "551 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces rigatoni or mezzi rigatoni", "Kosher salt", "8 ounces high-quality bacon, coarsely chopped", "4 large eggs", "Freshly ground black pepper", "4 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 bunch kale or collard greens, thick stems removed, leaves torn into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "1/4 cup finely grated pecorino or Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until it's just al dente.
