This dish pairs the golden spears of fried eggplant with milky ricotta cheese, fried garlic slices, red-pepper flakes and a generous drizzle of honey. You can serve it as a first course, a substantial side dish or a light main course with a green salad on the side. Note that tender, young eggplant cook a lot more quickly than denser, larger ones, and are worth seeking out here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/04appe1/merlin_161591136_8f385ead-5f37-42f7-a114-7e557670ad26-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, eggplant, garlic, honey, ricotta, fall, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 242}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds Japanese or other slender eggplant, cut into 3-inch-by-1-inch spears", "Fine sea salt, as needed", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "12 ounces whole-milk ricotta\u00a0", "1 tablespoon honey, or to taste", "Red-pepper flakes, to taste", "Flaky sea salt, to taste", "1/3 cup torn fresh basil leaves", "Lemon or lime wedges, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sprinkle eggplant lightly with fine sea salt, and let sit while you heat the skillet."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium.
