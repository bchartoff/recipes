{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cinnamon Rolls", "description": "What these cinnamon rolls lack in bells and whistles, they make up for in butter and brown sugar. As classic as can be, they are also the ultimate make-ahead breakfast treat, because they can be assembled the night before baking. The success of these rolls depends on the yeast to provide proper lift and rise, so make sure yours is still fresh and alive before diving in. Also be sure to budget a few hours for letting the dough rest and rise. This recipe calls for a 9-by-13 baking pan, but if you have a 9-inch round pan, feel free to use that instead; the rolls will be more tightly huddled together, beckoning to be pulled apart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/dining/ar-cinnamon-rolls/merlin_147610815_a671c63a-47a9-44a0-88fa-79a8ee282494-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "9 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, pastries", "keywords": "brown sugar, cinnamon, yeast, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1662}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 684, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "120 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "410 milligrams", "sugarContent": "74 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup whole milk", "4 tablespoons sugar", "2 1/4 teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1/4-ounce envelope)", "4 cups/510 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted", "Nonstick spray or vegetable oil, for the bowl", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/114 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "3 cups/362 grams confectioners' sugar", "5 to 6 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Warm milk in a small pot over medium heat until it\u2019s warm to the touch but not yet simmering (110 degrees).
