These rice cakes, which work well as a side dish to a piece of grilled meat or fish, offer the delicious crunch of Korean nurunji or Middle eastern hkaka, with some of the herbed cheesy goodness of Italian arancini. The basic recipe can be used to accommodate vegetables other than zucchini and herbs other than mint, or can be made without either for a more simple backdrop for a fried egg or a simple snack for a child.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/23/dining/23JPRICE3/23JPRICE3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 cakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cheddar, mint, rice, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 201}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 558, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "461 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups leftover white rice, preferably long-grain or Carolina Gold", "2 eggs, lightly beaten", "1 cup finely chopped zucchini", "3 tablespoons chopped mint", "1/3 cup green onion, chopped", "1 cup sharp white Cheddar, grated on the large hole of a box grater", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "2 tablespoons butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, gently mix everything except the butter.
