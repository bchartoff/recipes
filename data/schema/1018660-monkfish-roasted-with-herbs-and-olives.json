{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Monkfish Roasted With Herbs and Olives", "description": "Firm-fleshed fish can be described as \"meaty\" \u2014 monkfish fits this category \u2014 and are often best roasted in a hot oven. Tart lemon slices, aromatic herbs and olives enhance and complement that meatiness, just as they would roast lamb or chicken. A smear of rustic zesty black olive paste is the perfect condiment to complete this simple dish. Use whatever kind of olives appeal to you. At most supermarket self-serve olive bars you can combine 3 or 4 types in one container. I prefer a mixture of green and black whole olives with pits to roast with the fish. For the olive paste, pitted black olives are ideal. But it\u2019s fine to use just one type of olive, of course, and go pit-free throughout \u2014 it is a forgiving, malleable sort of recipe. To that end, if monkfish is unavailable, consider halibut, swordfish, grouper, sea bass or snapper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/29/dining/29KITCHEN1/29KITCHEN1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "gluten-free, lemon, monkfish, olives, rosemary, thyme, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 144}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds monkfish fillet, preferably in 1 or 2 large pieces (or use halibut, swordfish, grouper, sea bass or snapper)", "Salt and pepper", "Thyme sprigs", "Rosemary sprigs", "A few fresh bay leaves (optional)", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small lemon, thinly sliced", "12 whole black or green olives, pitted if desired", "1/4 cup pitted black olives, such as ni\u00e7oise, Gaeta or kalamata", "1 small garlic clove, peeled and minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Tie the monkfish fillets with butcher\u2019s twine at 2-inch intervals.
