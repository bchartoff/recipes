Remove the chicken and endive from the marinade and grill until the chicken is just cooked through, about 5 minutes, and the endive is soft and browned, about 5 to 6 minutes.

Place the endive on a sheet pan and cook in the broiler, turning occasionally, until tender and browned, 6 to 7 minutes.) Transfer the chicken to a serving plate and surround with the endive.
