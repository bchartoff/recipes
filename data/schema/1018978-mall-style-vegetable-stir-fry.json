{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mall-Style Vegetable Stir-Fry", "description": "The vegan chef Jenn\u00e9 Claiborne grew up in suburban Atlanta, where she developed a love for the teriyaki chicken stir-fry at Panda Express. After she became vegan, she recreated the flavors of her teen-age craving, using dates and soy sauce to produce the flavor of teriyaki sauce. If you don\u2019t have chickpeas on hand to add heft to the vegetables, replace them with tempeh, tofu, edamame, jackfruit or mushrooms. Also, feel free to swap out the broccoli in favor of another green vegetable like kale, cabbage or bok choy. To make a less salty, slightly less mall-like version, use low-sodium soy sauce or 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 water or broth. You can also use low-sodium canned chickpeas (or soak and cook your own and salt to taste).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/dining/29VeganRex2/29VeganRex2-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "broccoli, chickpea, dates, ginger, grapeseed oil, main course, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 343}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 373, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1965 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon grapeseed oil", "1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup soy sauce", "3 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "6 Medjool or other dried dates, pitted and chopped", "1 tablespoon arrowroot powder or cornstarch", "1 tablespoon grapeseed or coconut oil", "1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion, or 2 shallots, thinly sliced", "1 red bell pepper, chopped or julienned", "1 carrot, chopped or julienned", "1 head broccoli, cut into bite-sized florets and pieces", "1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas (1 15-ounce can, drained and rinsed)", "Freshly cooked brown rice, for serving", "1 tablespoon sesame seeds (raw or toasted)", "1 to 2 fresh limes, quartered", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.
