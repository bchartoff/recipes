{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlic Broth", "description": "Whole cloves of garlic, uncut and simmered gently for an hour with aromatics, yield a mild, sweet tasting, comforting broth that makes an ideal vegetarian stand-in for chicken broth. According to nutritionist Johnny Bowden, garlic needs to be crushed, sliced, or chopped in order for its compounds to be released. For this broth, I just crush the cloves lightly by leaning on them with the flat side of my knife. The less crushed they are, the milder the broth will taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/12/01/health/nutrition/01recipehealth.ready/01recipehealth.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 65}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "16 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 heads garlic", "2 quarts water", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "A bouquet garni made with a bay leaf, a couple of sprigs each thyme and parsley, and a fresh sage leaf", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium saucepan full of water to a boil.
