{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mark Bittman\u2019s Shrimp In Green Sauce", "description": "Green sauce means different things to different cooks, but I like the Iberian interpretation best. It draws its color from parsley and its impact from chilies, scallions, and, mostly, garlic. I find it difficult to use too much garlic here, and have never really reached the outer limit; my recipe calls for six cloves, but twice that amount is not unreasonable. \n\nShrimp is the perfect candidate for this green sauce: it can withstand high heat, it gives off some juices while it cooks, and its pink hue is absolutely gorgeous when surrounded by the flecks of green. \n\nThis dish won't take you much more than half an hour. And although it's a perfect week-night meal, divided into eight it makes an impressive starter for a dinner party.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/08/dining/08SHRIMPGREENSAUCE/08SHRIMPGREENSAUCE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "portuguese, spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, garlic, scallion, shrimp, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1004}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 359, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1298 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cloves garlic, peeled", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "6 scallions, trimmed and chopped", "1 cup parsley, leaves and thin stems", "2 pounds shrimp, peeled", "Salt and pepper to taste", "4 dried chilies or a few pinches of crushed red chili flakes, or to taste", "1/3 cup stock (shrimp, fish or chicken) or white wine or water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 500 degrees.
