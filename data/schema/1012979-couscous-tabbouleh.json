Mix together 1/4 cup of the lemon juice and the water, and pour over the couscous. Let sit for 30 minutes, stirring the mixture from time to time or rubbing between your fingers and thumbs to prevent it from lumping. Cover with a plate, and microwave on 100 per cent power for one minute; or line a steamer with a kitchen towel, place the couscous in it and steam for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the plate, or remove from the steamer, and return to the bowl. Stir in the remaining lemon juice and the olive oil, and allow to cool. Toss with the remaining ingredients, except the lettuce leaves. Taste and adjust seasonings. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve, using the romaine lettuce leaves as scoopers."}]}
