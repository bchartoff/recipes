The chiles caramelize as they roast, becoming spicy and sweet. If you want to reduce the heat slightly, use two jalape\u00f1os instead of three. Serve with steamed white or brown rice, spooning the extra glaze over the salmon and rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/11/dining/lh-chile-and-honey-roasted-salmon/merlin_165684687_b76a3730-bb9c-44d6-9b56-fae20467eb5f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "cilantro, honey, jalape\u00f1o, lime, salmon, vinegar, dairy-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 588}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup honey", "3 medium jalape\u00f1os, thinly sliced crosswise into rings", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or rice wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari", "4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, about 1-inch thick", "Olive oil, for brushing", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1/2 lime, for serving", "Chopped fresh cilantro, for serving (optional)", "Steamed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
