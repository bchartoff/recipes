The downside is that it can be bland. Amanda Cohen, the chef at Dirt Candy in Manhattan, loves the easy part. \u201cIf you\u2019re a chef, the idea of cooking at home on your one night off is like some kind of terrible nightmare,\u201d she said. \u201cTakeout becomes your best friend. but before long half your fridge is taken up by those little white cartons of rice.\u201d At home, she digs into those cartons to make fast batches of vegetable fried rice, and she combats the threat of blandness by stocking her freezer in advance with her <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017249-amanda-cohens-secret-weapon-stir-fry-sauce\">Secret-Weapon Stir-Fry Sauce</a>: small, dark green ice blocks of pur\u00e9ed garlic, ginger, cilantro, parsley and other ingredients, which she freezes in ice-cube trays (they can be slipped directly into the hot pan). She uses brussels sprouts, fennel, chard and mushrooms, but this dish is the definition of flexibility. \u201cAs long as you maintain the proportions, this recipe can take any vegetable you throw at it,\u201d she said. \u201cThink of it as a chance to clean out your crisper drawer.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/25/dining/25DIRTJP3/25DIRTJP3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 main course servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, chard, cremini, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon sesame oil", "4 tablespoons canola oil", "1 cup of trimmed and quartered brussels sprouts", "1 cup diced fennel", "2 cups chopped chard", "1 cup chopped cremini mushrooms", "4 loosely packed cups of leftover rice (about 1 large, quart-size carton, or 2 small pint-size cartons)", "Rice wine vinegar, to taste", "4 frozen cubes (or 4 tablespoons fresh) Secret Weapon Stir-Fry Sauce (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017249-amanda-cohens-secret-weapon-stir-fry-sauce\">see recipe</a>)", "Soy sauce, to taste", "Fish sauce, to taste", "Hot sauce, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat sesame oil and canola oil in a large pan or a wok over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers.
