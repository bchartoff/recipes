{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tacos de Picadillo", "description": "In Texas, picadillo is a ground-beef mixture that can be tucked into tacos, stuffed into peppers or burritos, or even eaten like stew with tortillas. Ad\u00e1n Medrano, a chef and writer whose work focuses on the Mexican-American food he grew up on in South Texas, created this dish based on the rolled tacos served for nearly seven decades at the Malt House in San Antonio, a beloved Texas Mexican spot that was demolished in 2018. The meat is flavored with what Mr. Medrano calls the \u201choly trinity,\u201d a Texas Mexican spice paste of peppercorns, cumin and garlic. While many Mexican-Americans soften the tortillas in hot oil as for enchiladas, Mr. Medrano dips them in caldito, a broth created from the picadillo liquid.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rachel Wharton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/dining/22mexicanrex2/22mexicanrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 tacos", "recipeCuisine": "american, mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, meat, tacos", "keywords": "corn tortillas, ground beef, salsa, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 132}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 189, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "214 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds", "1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "1 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil", "1 pound lean ground beef", "1/2 medium white onion, halved and thinly sliced", "Kosher salt", "10 corn tortillas, plus more as needed (see Tip)", "1 cup thinly sliced iceberg lettuce, seasoned with salt", "1 plum tomato, diced and seasoned with salt", "Rice and beans, for serving", "Salsa ranchera or other cooked tomato salsa (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a mortar and pestle to mash the garlic, cumin seeds and peppercorns into a smooth paste.
