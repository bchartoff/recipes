{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Matzo Lasagna", "description": "In this browned baked dish, matzo crackers replace the usual pasta for a rich, ricotta-filled lasagna that\u2019s Passover-friendly and relatively easy. In this version, the ricotta is flecked with basil, and the marinara sauce gently spiced with garlic and a touch of red-pepper flakes. Feel free to use the recipe as a template to create your own combinations \u2014 adding vegetables, other herbs and other cheeses as you like. The heady tomato sauce and bubbling, golden mozzarella on top can frame whatever other ingredients you\u2019d like to add. You can assemble the matzo lasagna the day before you bake it (store it in the fridge); just add a few minutes onto the baking time. If you are using handmade shmurah matzo, soak the sheets for 5 minutes in water before layering them. Supermarket matzo, which is lighter and more airy, does not need to be soaked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/18/dining/12apperex/12apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "basil, matzo, mozzarella, ricotta, tomato, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 521}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 501, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "928 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "4 anchovies, finely chopped (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "1 rosemary sprig", "2 3/4 cups/24 ounces whole-milk ricotta, preferably fresh", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup basil leaves, chopped, plus more for serving", "3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 (10-ounce) box matzo, preferably egg or salted matzo", "1 pound fresh mozzarella, sliced, then torn into bite-size pieces", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
