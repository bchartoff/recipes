{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warm Lentil Salad With Goat Cheese", "description": "Even people who swear they don\u2019t abide beans find pleasure in the distinctive, profound flavor of lentils. They also cook quickly, and you want them on the al dente side for this salad. That means they\u2019ll be ready in 25 minutes, still a long enough simmering time to yield a savory broth.\n\nGoat cheese and lentils make a particularly good pairing; the little earthy-sweet legumes love a salty-umami complement (that\u2019s why you so often see them paired with sausage and other cured pork products), and goat cheese fits the bill. Here the combination is especially cozy, as the cheese melts into the warm lentils, bathing them in a creamy dressing.\n\nLentils and vinegar also marry well. The key here is to add the dressing while the lentils are still warm, even if you don\u2019t plan on serving the salad warm.\n\nI spoon the mixture onto a bed of wild arugula, though regular will do if you can\u2019t find the sharper tasting, wispy wild variety.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/10/science/14recipehealtharugula/14recipehealtharugula-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "arugula, garlic, goat cheese, lentils, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 269}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 427, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "335 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/14 ounces green, brown or black lentils, rinsed and picked over", "1 small or 1/2 large onion, halved", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 bay leaf", "Salt", "1/4 cup red wine vinegar or sherry vinegar", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup broth from the lentils", "3 to 4 ounces goat cheese (to taste), crumbled", "Black pepper", "1/4 cup minced chives or parsley, or both", "2 cups wild or baby arugula"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, combine lentils, onion, two of the garlic cloves and the bay leaf  with 6 cups water.
