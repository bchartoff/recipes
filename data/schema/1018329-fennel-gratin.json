{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fennel Gratin", "description": "This rich, elegant gratin, adapted from the chef Naomi Pomeroy's book \"Taste and Technique,\" brings together braised fennel, Gruy\u00e8re sauce and crisp bread crumbs, with outrageously delicious results. As with many recipes in this highly instructive book, this gratin is more labor intensive than what you may expect \u2014 coarse bread crumbs are toasted and shattered just so \u2014 but every component is key to the final dish. A lot happens simultaneously, so breathe deep, and be sure to prep your ingredients before beginning, and carefully read through the recipe to the end (a good practice always). If you'd like to get a head start, the bread crumbs may be toasted and stored at room temperature; the fennel and cheese sauce can be made up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated, separately, until you are ready to assemble, bake and serve. It's ideal for entertaining.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christine Muhlke"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28TECHNIQUE2-WEB/28TECHNIQUE2-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "bread crumbs, fennel, gruy\u00e8re, parmigiano-reggiano, white wine, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 57}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 large loaf artisanal bread (about 5 ounces)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon garlic paste (see note)", "1/2 teaspoon fennel pollen", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped fennel fronds (optional)", "4 or 5 large fennel bulbs (3 to 4 inches), or 6 to 8 small bulbs (2 to 3 inches), with some fronds attached", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3/4 cup chicken stock, preferably homemade", "1/4 cup good white wine", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons garlic paste (see note)", "2 1/2 cups whole milk", "3 ounces cave-aged Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "2 ounces cave-aged Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated", "2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, ground (see note) or finely chopped by hand"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toast the bread crumbs: Heat oven to 250 degrees.
