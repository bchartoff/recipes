{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cucumber Salad With Roasted Peanuts and Chile", "description": "Easy to assemble but far from basic, this cucumber salad delivers a riot of flavors and textures with snappy cucumbers, velvety peanut sauce, crunchy cilantro-peanut topping and zingy chile oil. The details make all the difference: First, salting the cucumbers mutes the fruit\u2019s subtly bitter notes while heightening flavor. Next, the simple peanut sauce adds richness to the cool cucumbers. (Make a large batch and store it in the fridge to drizzle over vegetables, chicken and salads.) Finally, a flurry of finely chopped peanuts, cilantro and red-pepper flakes gets dusted over the salad in layers to disperse flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/02/dining/sl-cucumber-salad/merlin_153444042_d4e426e3-54b2-4d6f-a1f2-82fdb61b9122-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, snack, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, chili oil, cilantro, cucumber, peanut, peanut butter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 754}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 Persian cucumbers (about 1 pound), cut lengthwise into thin spears, then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt", "1/4 cup salted, roasted peanuts", "1/4 cup cilantro leaves", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "3 tablespoons natural unsalted peanut butter", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 small garlic clove, grated", "Chile oil, store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016203-chinese-chile-scallion-oil\">homemade</a>, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss cucumbers with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a colander.
