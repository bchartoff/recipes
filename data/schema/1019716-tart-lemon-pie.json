Use fresh squeezed lemon juice for the brightest flavor. Serve it with lightly sweetened whipped cream to temper the tartness, if you like; you could also skip the decorative triangles for a more classic look (in which case you only need to prepare dough for a single crust). You can make and chill the pie up to 1 day ahead, but don\u2019t add the triangles until just before serving.
