Instead, it\u2019s the large, crisp chunks of eggplant that star, enrobed in basil-scented marinara sauce and topped with a melting, creamy mix of\u00a0burrata\u00a0and ricotta. In this recipe adapted from the chef Amy\u00a0Brandwein\u00a0of\u00a0Centrolina\u00a0in Washington, D.C., the cubed eggplant is topped with crunchy, salty eggplant chips, sliced ultrathin and deep-fried until golden.
