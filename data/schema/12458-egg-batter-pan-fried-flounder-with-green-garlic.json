{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Egg Batter Pan-Fried Flounder With Green Garlic", "description": "For savory, moist, delicate flounder, it is difficult to beat this fast, easy method. Lightly coat the fillets in flour, then dip them in a mixture of beaten egg and milk. Slide them into a hot skillet filled with oil to a 1/4-inch depth and let them fry until golden, a mere two minutes or so per side, without jostling them around too much. Serve with a sauce of green garlic cooked in butter, with the juice of half a lemon providing a jaunty, bright finish. A sprinkling of chopped parsley makes for an elegant presentation, lifting an already elevated weeknight dish. Use fluke or sole in place of the flounder if you\u2019d like, or scallions for the green garlic.
