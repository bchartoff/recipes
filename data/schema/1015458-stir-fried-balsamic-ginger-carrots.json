{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Balsamic Ginger Carrots", "description": "The carrots need to be cut as uniformly as possible so that all the vegetables cook in the same amount of time. If the carrots are skinny (about 1/2 to 3/4 inch in diameter), simply cut them into 2-inch pieces; if they\u2019re medium (about 1 inch in diameter), cut lengthwise in half before cutting into 2-inch pieces; if they\u2019re large (about 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), quarter lengthwise before cutting into 2-inch pieces. Blanching the carrots reduces the amount of oil necessary to stir-fry. Mince the ginger by hand; if you use a grater or microplane, the ginger will be too wet and will spatter in the oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/08/health/Well_veggie_carrots/Well_veggie_carrots-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 107}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 75, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "226 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 pounds carrots, cut diagonally into 2-inch pieces (about 5 cups)", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "1 tablespoon dry sherry", "2 teaspoons soy sauce (low-sodium if desired)", "3/4 teaspoon sugar", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons peanut or canola oil", "2 tablespoons minced ginger", "2 tablespoons finely chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 3-quart saucepan, bring 1 1/2 quarts water to a boil over high heat.
