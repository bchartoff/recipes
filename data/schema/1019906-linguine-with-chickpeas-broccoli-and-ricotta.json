In this 20-minute recipe, kale, broccoli and chickpeas crisp under the broiler while the pasta water boils. Make sure to spread out the vegetables and chickpeas so they have room to caramelize properly instead of steaming (the more crunchy bits, the better). Finish by tossing the pasta and vegetables with a quick sauce of butter, lemon zest and fresh ricotta, a rich and creamy complement to the charred vegetables. Enjoy with crusty bread, good wine and a sense of accomplishment \u2014 you just got dinner on the table in under a half hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/dining/sc-Roasted-Broccoli--Kale-and-Chickpea-Linguine-with-Fresh-Ricotta/merlin_149536176_2d6b149c-fc46-400d-8f34-e63bbc5efd8f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "broccoli, chickpeas, kale, pasta, ricotta, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 751}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 850, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "105 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1132 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "12 ounces dried linguine or spaghetti", "1 bunch broccoli or broccolini, trimmed and cut into thin florets (about 1 1/2 pounds), stems reserved for another use", "1 (14-ounce) can chickpeas or other white beans, drained and rinsed", "2 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "Black pepper", "1 bunch Tuscan kale (also known as cavolo nero or Lacinato kale), stemmed and cut into bite-size pieces", "1 lemon", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "8 ounces ricotta, preferably room temperature", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
