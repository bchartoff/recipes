{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Zuni Caf\u00e9\u2019s Focaccia", "description": "The excellent hamburger at Zuni Caf\u00e9 in San Francisco has always been served on a square of toasted rosemary focaccia. The pastry chef Annie Callan offers this house recipe: Scaled to a reasonable size, it is easy to put together and fun to make. Bake it in a 9-by-12-inch rimmed baking sheet for a nice, thick focaccia that can be cut into six 4-inch squares (the trimmings are a delicious snack), and split horizontally into a hamburger bun. The baked focaccia can be kept for several days in an airtight container and needs only a brief toasting to bring it back to life. But you can also roll the dough thinner and bake a more pizzalike flatbread, perhaps topped with stewed onions or peppers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/06/dining/06kitchrex-zunifoccacia/merlin_150546081_d75979bf-29cd-456c-87b1-99fcd83fef12-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 squares", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, breads", "keywords": "bread flour, rosemary, yeast, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 170}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters warm water", "1 1/2 teaspoons dry active yeast", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing pan", "2 teaspoons minced rosemary", "1 2/3 cups/215 grams bread flour", "1 2/3 cups/215 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "Fine cornmeal or semolina, for dusting bottom of pan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the mixing bowl of a stand mixer, combine water and yeast, stirring to dissolve.
