{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Grapes With Caramelized Wine and Yogurt Ice Cream", "description": "In this recipe, grapes take on a floral, caramelized flavor from fresh thyme and honey. If your thyme is woody, discard the stems and just use the leaves. If you don\u2019t have an ice cream machine, the ice cream mixture can be placed directly in the freezer without churning. It won\u2019t be quite as creamy and smooth, but quite good enough. You will get more ice cream than you need for serving with the grapes, but eating the leftovers is no hardship.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/18/dining/18Baking1/18Baking1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "concord grapes, cream, greek yogurt, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 484, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "81 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "42 milligrams", "sugarContent": "76 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated or superfine sugar (caster sugar)", "3 strips orange zest, plus 1/3 cup/60 milliliters orange juice", "1 strip lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams Greek yogurt", "1 cup /200 grams heavy cream (double cream)", "1 1/2 pounds/600 grams red seedless grapes, off the stem", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/90 milliliters muscat wine (or another sweet dessert wine such as port or Madeira)", "2 tablespoons honey", "1/4 cup/5 grams loosely packed lemon thyme (or regular thyme) sprigs, or use leaves if sprigs are woody", "2 tablespoons/30 grams soft dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "At least 1 day before you plan to serve, make the ice cream: In a medium saucepan, combine sugar and 1 cup/200 milliliters of water over medium-high heat.
