Congee is a rice porridge popular in China and among other Asian cuisines, and this version is heavily spiced with cumin and turmeric, which lend a golden hue and an earthy flavor. If you haven\u2019t made congee before, you might balk at the high ratio of water to rice, but give it time, and the rice will break down until creamy. Spiced chicken, tangy yogurt and a punchy blender hot sauce add texture, richness and brightness to the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/aw-halal-congee/aw-halal-congee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, condiments, grains and rice, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, cumin, jasmine rice, turmeric, yogurt, za\u2019atar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 118}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon neutral oil", "3 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed", "1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed", "1/2 peeled white onion, cut into 2 wedges", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "Kosher salt", "3/4 cup plain yogurt", "2/3 cup mayonnaise, preferably Kewpie brand", "1 tablespoon za\u2019atar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup chopped jarred roasted red bell pepper", "1/2 cup Crystal hot sauce", "1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar", "Kosher salt", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "1/4 cup ground turmeric", "3 tablespoons ground cumin", "2 tablespoons ground cardamom", "Kosher salt", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "Julienned iceberg lettuce", "Diced tomato"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the rice: In a small skillet, saut\u00e9 the garlic in oil over medium-high heat, until deep golden brown all over, about 3 minutes.
