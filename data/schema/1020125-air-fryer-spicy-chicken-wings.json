{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Air-Fryer Spicy Chicken Wings", "description": "Chicken wings turn out perfectly when they\u2019re cooked in an air fryer. Here, they are tossed with a bit of baking powder before frying, which yields a particularly crunchy, browned skin with a rough, craggy texture. It\u2019s a technique based on one from Ben Mims\u2019s cookbook, \u201cAir Fry Every Day\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2018), which he learned from J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt from Serious Eats. After frying, the wings are tossed with a honey and chile-based sauce spiked with fresh lemon juice and zest. Sticky, fiery and impossible to stop eating, they are an easier, leaner version of deep-fried chicken wings, made without the mess.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/dining/03airrex2/02airrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, poultry", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, chicken wings, honey, sriracha, tabasco sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 72}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 298, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "343 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pound chicken wings, cut in half through the joint into wingettes and drumettes", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon honey, preferably dark", "1/2 teaspoon Tabasco sauce", "1/4 teaspoon Sriracha or other Asian chile sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, toss chicken with baking powder, salt and pepper until the pieces are thoroughly coated.
