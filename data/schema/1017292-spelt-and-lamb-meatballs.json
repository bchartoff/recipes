{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spelt and Lamb Meatballs", "description": "Fragrant with cinnamon and allspice and imbued with parsley and dill, these meatballs are like a cross between a falafel and lamb kibbe, with a crunchy crust. Starchy spelt helps the balls hold their shape and adds a pleasing chewy texture, while a small amount of lamb contributes its brawny, mineral flavor. Feel free to try these meatballs with other ground meats \u2014turkey, chicken, beef or pork should all work nicely. Other whole grain berries (wheat, rye, barley) can be substituted for the spelt. Just make sure to cook the grains until they are quite tender and the bran splits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/18/dining/18APPETITE2/18APPETITE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, meatballs", "keywords": "ground lamb, spelt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 199, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "311 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 scallions", "1/4 cup parsley leaves", "1/4 cup dill sprigs, more for garnish", "2 fat or 3 smaller garlic cloves, grated", "2 1/4 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, or to taste", "1 red chile or jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded and roughly chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "3 cups cooked spelt or other whole grain berries", "1/2 pound ground lamb", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for frying", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice scallions, keeping the light green and white parts separate from the dark green.
