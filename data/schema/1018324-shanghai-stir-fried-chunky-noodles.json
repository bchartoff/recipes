{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shanghai Stir-Fried Chunky Noodles", "description": "This Shanghainese noodle recipe, from the British cook and food writer Fuchsia Dunlop, can be made vegetarian by omitting the pork. Do seek out light and dark soy sauces; light soy sauce adds salty-umami flavor and dark soy sauce adds color.\n\nTraditional woks are made from carbon steel, and must be routinely seasoned to keep from rusting. To season, heat the wok on high, turn off the flame and use a paper towel to wipe the interior with vegetable oil. Repeat if necessary. A deep frying pan with high sides will work for this recipe if you don't have a wok.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28CHINESE2/28CHINESE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "noodles", "keywords": "bok choy, pork, soy sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 372}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 574, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "89 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "594 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces lean pork, from a boneless pork loin chop or a tenderloin", "1/2 teaspoon plus 2 tablespoons light soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "1 pound fresh Shanghai noodles or Japanese udon noodles", "2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil, plus a splash", "1 tablespoon dark soy sauce", "2 tablespoons chicken stock", "10 ounces green baby bok choy or 2 large handfuls of baby spinach", "Salt and ground white pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the pork evenly into 1/4-inch slices, then into 1/8-inch slivers."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine 1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce, the Shaoxing wine, the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon cold water and mix well.
