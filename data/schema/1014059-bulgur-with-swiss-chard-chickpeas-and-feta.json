{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bulgur With Swiss Chard, Chickpeas and Feta", "description": "Bulgur comes in one of four grades: fine (bags are often labeled #1), medium (#2), coarse (#3) and very coarse (#4). The different grinds are used for specific types of dishes. Pilafs are made with medium, coarse or very coarse bulgur. Tabbouleh and kibbe are made with fine bulgur.This is a convenient grain to keep on hand in the pantry. It\u2019s easy to find in whole foods stores and in Middle Eastern markets. Don\u2019t confuse it with cracked wheat, which is another product made from raw wheat berries. Because bulgur is made from precooked wheat berries, it takes only about 20 minutes to reconstitute by soaking or by simmering. It has a wonderful nutty flavor and a light texture.
