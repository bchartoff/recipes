{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fatty Crab's Chili Crab", "description": "Matt Lee and Ted Lee snatched this recipe for chili crab from chef Zakary Pelaccio before the first Fatty Crab opened in New York. There are now locations in St. John and Hong Kong. With the restaurant, Pelaccio pays homage to a crab joint he frequented during a seven-month cooking stint in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This recipe calls for blue crabs and spices them up with chili sauce, garlic and ginger among much else. Serve with crab picks, cold beer and many napkins.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Matt Lee And Ted Lee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/27/dining/Crab/Crab-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "crab, garlic, sriracha, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 188, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1001 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons chili sauce, like sriracha", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sugar", "3 tablespoons rice-wine vinegar", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 cup chopped shallots (about 8 ounces)", "4 cloves garlic, sliced", "1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger", "teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 tablespoon peanut oil", "8 blue crabs, cleaned and split, large claws slightly cracked", "1 egg yolk, beaten", "1/2 cup chopped scallions for garnishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk the chili sauce, soy sauce, sugar, rice-wine vinegar, tomato paste and sesame oil with 1 1/4 cups water and reserve."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the shallots, garlic, ginger and salt in the bowl of a food processor.
