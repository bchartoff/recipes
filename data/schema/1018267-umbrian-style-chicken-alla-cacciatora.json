It\u2019s lovely served with steamed greens dressed with a fruity olive oil, over homemade mashed potatoes or polenta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/14/dining/14UMBRIA-RECIPES1/14UMBRIA-RECIPES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "capers, chicken, olives, rosemary, sage leaves, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1005}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 590, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "942 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil", "1 small chicken (about 2 1/2 pounds), cut into serving pieces, or use bone-in, skin-on thighs and drumsticks", "1 onion, sliced", "2 to 3 cloves garlic, very finely minced", "1 tablespoon capers", "1/4 cup good-quality brine-cured olives, black or green, with pits", "1 sprig rosemary", "1 handful sage leaves", "Salt and black pepper", "1 cup dry white wine", "Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large non-stick pan.
