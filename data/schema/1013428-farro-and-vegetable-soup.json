{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro and Vegetable Soup", "description": "This thick, hearty meal is inspired by a traditional Proven\u00e7al harvest soup. Farro (spelt) and the softer emmer wheat are grains that were once peasant staples in the mountainous areas of Provence, though they are less common now. Traditionally, the grain is simmered with a mutton, prosciutto or ham bone. I use Parmesan rinds to enrich the flavor of this version.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/01/11/science/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "Serves six to eight", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, soups and stews", "keywords": "fall, farro, vegetables, healthy, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 202, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1005 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups farro (spelt), rinsed", "1 ounce (about 1 cup) dried porcini mushrooms", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 onion, chopped", "1/2 pound carrots, chopped", "2 celery stalks with leaves, chopped", "1/2 pound cabbage, shredded or finely chopped", "2 to 4 large garlic cloves, to taste, minced", "A bouquet garni made with a bay leaf, a few sprigs of thyme and parsley, and a couple of Parmesan rinds, all tied in a cheesecloth", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 1/2 quarts water, chicken stock or vegetable stock", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "2 ounces Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated 1/2 cup Parmesan may be substituted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the farro just covered in water for one hour or longer.
