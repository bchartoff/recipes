Tuna (packed in olive oil, please) is mixed with peppers, fresh herbs and nuts and dressed in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice and two types of mustard. It can sit in the fridge for up to three days, making it excellent picnic food or just a departure from the usual sad desk sandwich.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Toby Cecchini"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/07/dining/tunasalad/tunasalad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "gluten-free, pepperoncini, tuna, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 156}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "383 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 to 12 ounces good-quality solid tuna packed in olive oil, well drained", "2 scallions washed, trimmed and chopped fine", "6 pepperoncini peppers, destemmed and julienned", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill", "1/4 cup roasted or smoked almonds, chopped roughly, or a small handful toasted pine nuts", "1/4 cup good-quality olive oil (or the oil the tuna was packed in)", "1 tablespoon smooth Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice or more to taste", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix all the ingredients well with a fork in a medium-size, nonreactive bowl.
