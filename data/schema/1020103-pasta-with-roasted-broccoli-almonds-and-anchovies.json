{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Roasted Broccoli, Almonds and Anchovies", "description": "This no-fuss weeknight pasta makes marvelous use of basic ingredients found in almost every kitchen \u2014 and calls for some smart multitasking: Get the broccoli roasting while the pasta cooks, then create an easy emulsified sauce using butter, anchovies, red-pepper flakes, lemon juice and a splash of pasta cooking water. A sprinkle of toasted almonds provides texture and crunch. This dish is endlessly adaptable: Go for cauliflower instead of the broccoli (or a combination of the two); use parmesan or any other hard cheese in place of pecorino; opt for\u00a0walnuts or pistachios instead of the almonds \u2014 or bypass nuts altogether and use toasted panko or breadcrumbs. If you don\u2019t have campanelle or fusilli, that\u2019s fine too. Any pasta with plenty of nooks and crannies to capture the buttery sauce will do.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/18/dining/ch-pasta-with-roasted-broccoli-almonds-and-anchovies/merlin_150866628_2aaaec98-2ea9-4b07-98af-40680932169d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "almonds, anchovy fillets, broccoli, lemon, pasta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 338}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 579, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "568 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds broccoli, cut into bite-size florets, stems cut into 1/2-inch slices", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound shaped pasta, such as campanelle or fusilli", "1/2 cup chopped almonds", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick)", "6 to 8 anchovy fillets, roughly chopped", "2 garlic cloves, chopped", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/3 cup fresh lemon juice", "Grated pecorino, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
