His main break with tradition is his use of the fiery agave spirit mezcal as a base. Wanting the liquor to play well with the other ingredients, he opts for the sweeter, softer Crema de Mezcal, from Del Maguey. \u201cIt still has some of the smoky, spice qualities of mezcal, but some of the sweetness that works well with the bitterness of the Aperol,\u201d he said. At first, the mezcal delivers a bracing, spirited hit you don\u2019t expect from a spritz. But after a few sips, it all calms down into an easygoing, refreshing whole.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/22/dining/22SPRITZ5-WEB/22SPRITZ5-WEB-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "aperol, cocktail shaker, grapefruit juice, grapefruit twist, mezcal, sparkling white wine, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce Del Maguey Crema de Mezcal", "3/4 ounce Aperol", "1/4 ounce grapefruit juice", "Grapefruit twist", "4 ounces sparkling white wine, such as a dry cava or prosecco"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a cocktail shaker three-quarters filled with ice, add crema de mezcal, Aperol and grapefruit juice.
