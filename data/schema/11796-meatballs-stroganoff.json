{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meatballs Stroganoff", "description": "Stroganoff actually has a French connection going back to the 19th century. Aristocratic Russians of the time had commercial and cultural ties with France, and many upper-class Russians employed French cooks, who were always looking for ways to give French dishes a Russian twist. One of the most prominent families of the time was the Stroganoffs, who spent much time in Paris and had developed a love for French cuisine. Beef stroganoff is believed to have been created when the family chef added some sour cream, a Russian staple, to what was essentially a beef dish in a classic French mustard sauce. Here, Mr. Franey substitutes meatballs for the steak. The results are slightly lighter than the classic dish but full of flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-STROGANOFF/19COOKING-STROGANOFF-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beef, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 419, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "722 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound lean ground round steak", "1 egg, beaten", "1/3 cup fresh bread crumbs", "1 1/4 cup drained yogurt", "4 tablespoons grated onion", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "2 tablespoons paprika", "2 tablespoons butter", "1/4 pound mushrooms, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup chopped onions", "1 teaspoon chopped garlic", "1/4 cup sherry wine", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/4 cup finely chopped parsley or dill"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the meat in a mixing bowl, and add the egg.
