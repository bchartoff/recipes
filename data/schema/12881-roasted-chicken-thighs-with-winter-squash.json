{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Chicken Thighs With Winter Squash", "description": "Roasted chicken thighs can be the juicy, meaty center of many weeknight meals. Add delicata squash, quickly tossed in a maple syrup-butter glaze, along with slices of lemon and sage, and you have a something more unusual, an interplay of flavors that don\u2019t generally meet on the same sheet pan. This recipe is a little too fussy to count as a fast weeknight dish, but there is nothing difficult about any of the steps. And it\u2019s a fine introduction to delicata squash, if you haven\u2019t cooked with them yet. Unlike many other winter squash varieties, they have a thin skin and don\u2019t need to be peeled (just cut them in half and remove the seeds), making them as easy to prepare as they are sweet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/12/dining/12squash/12squash-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, delicata squash, maple syrup, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1139}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 488, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "812 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 lemon, ends trimmed, halved lengthwise, seeds removed, and thinly sliced crosswise into wedges", "4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 and 1/2 pounds)", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon chopped sage", "1 and 1/2 teaspoons coriander seed", "1 and 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup maple syrup", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "Large pinch chile powder", "1 delicata or acorn squash (1 and 1/4 pounds), seeded and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rings", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light-green parts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil; drop in lemon slices and cook for two minutes.
