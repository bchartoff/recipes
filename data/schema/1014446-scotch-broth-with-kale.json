{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scotch Broth with Kale", "description": "Here is a fairly basic recipe for stew, a low-and-slow variety that calls for simmering lamb (though you could use beef) with barley and root vegetables, then adding some kale at the end so that it doesn\u2019t entirely collapse. It\u2019s a simple equation that takes in whatever ingredients you have on hand. Start with meat, sturdy root vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes, turnips, rutabaga, parsnip, carrots) and grains (barley, wheat berries, farro), add water and simmer away. Then add kale, cabbage, spinach or chard. Dinner!
