A substantial salad, it can be a curtain raiser or part of a buffet for summer dinner at home. It might even be carried to a picnic. But it begs to be served a bit warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/14/dining/14PAIR_SPAN/14PAIR_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "seafood, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 372, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "555 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 large shrimp, peeled", "1/2 pound sea scallops, hard tendon removed", "1/2 pound swordfish, skinless, in 1 1/2-inch chunks", "2 small to medium calamari, cleaned", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1 small head radicchio, quartered", "2 slices sourdough bread from the center of a round loaf", "3 scallions, trimmed and chopped", "1 tablespoon capers in vinegar, drained", "1 clove garlic, peeled", "1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine shrimp, scallops, swordfish and calamari in a bowl.

If using a grill pan, heat the pan and brush it with a little oil before adding the shrimp, scallops, calamari and swordfish.

Remove to a large cutting board as it finishes cooking. Sear the calamari directly on the grill or in the grill pan, about 2 minutes per side. Add to cutting board. Sear the radicchio quarters briefly, turning once, and toast the bread on the grill.
