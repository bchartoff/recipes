Balanced with acidity.These were my descriptions of the South African cabernet sauvignon wines we tasted. They reminded me of just how good cabernet can be when the winemaker does not aim for a skyscraper when 10 stories will do. I wanted to enjoy the wines with lamb, and hearty shanks braised with fruit and spice did the trick. The acid balance in many of the wines gracefully tamed the richness of the sauce. You should figure one shank a person, so try to buy smallish ones, about a pound each. And serve the dish with couscous.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "lamb, red wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1015, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "73 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "1495 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup pitted prunes", "1 cup dry red wine", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "4 lamb shanks, about 1 pound each, fat well trimmed", "1 cup finely chopped onion", "8 cloves garlic, minced", "1 red bell pepper, cored and slivered", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "4 sprigs thyme", "2 teaspoons grated orange zest", "Cayenne to taste", "Cooked couscous for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place prunes in a bowl, add wine and set aside.
