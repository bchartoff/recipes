{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lot 2's Pecorino Fried Bread With Broccoli", "description": "Katherine Youngblood, the chef de cuisine at Lot 2 in Brooklyn, saut\u00e9es heirloom broccoli with garlic, chile flakes, anchovy and plenty of lemon, and serves it heaped on olive oil-fried bread showered with pecorino. The oily crunch of the bread, the saltiness of the cheese and the sweetness of the broccoli combine into something that, had it not been for my sense of propriety, would have had me licking the plate. I made a few minor edits while testing the recipe, taking down the olive oil by just a bit and streamlining the method. The result is a wonderful melding of simple ingredients and techniques that is easy to replicate at home, whenever the craving strikes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/06/dining/06TAKEOUT_SPAN/06TAKEOUT-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "appetizer, broccoli, country bread, pecorino", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 94}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 330, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "624 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound broccoli di ciccio, broccolette or regular broccoli", "4 garlic cloves", "1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "4 (1-inch thick) slices day-old pain au levain or rustic white bread", "6 anchovies, roughly chopped", "1/2 teaspoon chile flakes", "Juice and finely grated zest of 1/2 lemon", "Salt, to taste", "1/2 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
