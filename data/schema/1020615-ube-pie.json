{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ube Pie", "description": "Ube, a purple yam native to the Asian tropics, is a common ingredient in Filipino desserts. It\u2019s no surprise that colorful dishes made with ube have done well on Instagram, prompting the invention of drinks, custards, cakes and sweet breads in cities across the United States. This recipe is adapted from Caf\u00e9 86 in Artesia, Calif., where co-owner Ginger Dimapasok serves an ube chess pie that\u2019s particularly popular around Thanksgiving. The earthy, vanilla flavor of the yam adds color and depth to the sweet, buttery filling. You can find frozen mashed ube \u2014 and ube flavoring, which ensures a deep purple hue \u2014 at Filipino markets. Okinawa sweet potatoes, or Japanese purple sweet potatoes, can also be substituted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/12/dining/dg-ube-pie/merlin_163633197_41d364fa-ba2f-4e20-be5e-0c3536eb7467-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie (about 10 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "butter, graham cracker, ube, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 131}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ounces/140 grams graham crackers (1 sleeve), pulsed into fine crumbs in a food processor (about 1 cup)", "3 tablespoons/35 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted", "1 (1-pound/455-gram) package frozen grated ube (see Tip), defrosted", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 packed cup/110 grams light brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters heavy cream", "1/2 teaspoon ube flavoring\u00a0(optional)", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
