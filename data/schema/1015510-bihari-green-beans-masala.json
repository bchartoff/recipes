For the eggplant, Ms. Sahni uses the long, slender Japanese ones, and cuts them on the diagonal, in one-inch slices. She trims and peels the carrots, and cuts them like the eggplant, in one-inch diagonal slices. For the cauliflower, she uses the florets, and cuts them in pieces that are one and a half inches in diameter. For Brussels sprouts, she trims and discards the stems, and cuts the vegetable in half. Very fresh cauliflower cooks in four minutes, the other vegetables in six minutes, Ms. Sahni said.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elaine Louie"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "green beans, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 108}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 278, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "490 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons vegetable oil or light olive oil", "2 tablespoons sliced almonds", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "3 large cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon red chili pepper flakes", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup coconut milk", "3/4 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon lime juice", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a 3-quart saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat.
