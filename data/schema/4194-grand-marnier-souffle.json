{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grand Marnier Souffl\u00e9", "description": "This version of the classic French dessert is an adaptation of one attributed to Jean-Jacques Rachou, a former owner and chef of La C\u00f4te Basque, a restaurant The Times once called \"the high-society temple of classic French cuisine.\" These acclaimed souffl\u00e9s were a specialty at the restaurant, which closed its doors in 2004, after 45 years of serving guests like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Babe Paley and Frank Sinatra. Done right, they are airy, perfectly textured and deftly sweetened. The key is the density of the egg whites; they must be whipped until the peaks are firm but not too full of air.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Bryan Miller And Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-MARNIERSOUFFLE/19COOKING-MARNIERSOUFFLE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, times classics", "keywords": "dessert, eggs, grand marnier, gluten-free, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 136}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 257, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "77 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon soft butter", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "5 eggs, separated", "1/3 cup grated orange rind", "2 tablespoons Grand Marnier"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rub the butter on the bottom and sides of four 1-cup souffle dishes.
