Their long-standing alternative: stay home and eat well. The ritual starts with caviar and Champagne. Then Dad might prepare steak tartare and Mom, a chocolate souffl\u00e9. Good stuff. Now, all grown up (and then some), I realize they\u2019re on to something. A low-key, intimate gathering starring good food is my preferred way to ring in the new. But in these lean times \u2014 and in my significantly smaller kitchen \u2014 putting out a succulent spread and entertaining the troops chez moi calls for some creativity. This frittata can be cut in half and served as a meal for two with a bitter chicory salad, or sliced into strips and put into a salad of its own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Charlotte Druckman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 snack-size slices", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "bottarga, bread, eggs, sea salt", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["6 eggs", "2 teaspoons sea salt", "2 tablespoons chives, chopped", "Stale, crusty loaf of good Italian bread (Pugliese or ciabatta)", "Bottarga du tonno (for shaving)", "Olive oil (for the pan and for drizzling)", "A healthy dollop of sour cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "Freshly ground coarse black pepper to taste."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Crack eggs into a mixing bowl.
