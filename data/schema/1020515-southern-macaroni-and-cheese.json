{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Southern Macaroni and Cheese", "description": "There is macaroni and cheese, and then there is special occasion macaroni and cheese like this one. Unlike most recipes, which start with a roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base, which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky taste. It\u2019s adapted from Millie Peartree, the owner of Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food restaurant in the Bronx, who has been making this dish since she was a little girl growing up in Georgia. The recipe was passed down in her family for generations, but because of the generous amount of cheese used, the dish was only made for events like Christmas and Thanksgiving. Extra-sharp Cheddar adds tartness and a layer of Colby Jack creates a gooey, molten center. If you can\u2019t find a Colby Jack blend, shredded mozzarella or a Mexican-style blend will work in its place.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/dining/kwr-mac-and-cheese/merlin_161591055_8827b61f-8325-4cb6-8db2-12a941eacbb0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, casseroles, noodles, pastas", "keywords": "cheddar, colby cheese, macaroni, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2203}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound elbow macaroni", "2 cups whole milk", "2 large eggs", "4 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar (about 16 ounces)", "1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "2 cups shredded Colby Jack (about 8 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
