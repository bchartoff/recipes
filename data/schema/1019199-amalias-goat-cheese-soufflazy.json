{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Amalia\u2019s Goat-Cheese Soufflazy", "description": "This recipe offers a clever shortcut for a notoriously finicky dish, yielding an aromatic, billowy cloud of eggs, cheese and herbs. There are two tricks: First, separate and heat both the egg whites and yolks over a water bath before reuniting them. And second, don\u2019t overwhip the whites. Take them to a medium stiff peak \u2014 when upturned on a whisk, they should flop over a tiny bit. Serve soufflazy for breakfast, brunch or as a first course at a dinner party, with buttered toast and a salad of bitter greens or arugula.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/25/magazine/25mag-eat1/25mag-25eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "egg, goat cheese, gruy\u00e8re", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 292}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "573 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter for greasing pan", "8 large eggs, separated", "6 ounces goat cheese, crumbled (about a heaping cup)", "1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme", "Salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "3 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, finely grated on a box grater (about 1 heaping cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Adjust an oven rack to the center position.

Use a rubber spatula to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl every minute or so. The bowl should never get so hot that the eggs cook and begin to stick to the sides.
