{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Eggplant With Ricotta, Mozzarella and Anchovy", "description": "I learned this dish from a Sicilian cook in a small town outside Palermo. She makes it by layering thinly sliced eggplant with fresh curd cheese and\u00a0caciocavallo\u00a0(I use fresh ricotta and provolone instead), as well as\u00a0pecorino and Parmesan cheese \u2014 a bit like a lasagna without pasta. It is quite delicious and unusual in that there is no tomato sauce, as there often is in so many Sicilian baked eggplant dishes. The anchovies, melted into the crisp bread-crumb-and-cheese topping, provide a sharp contrast to the sweetness of the eggplant. I like to serve a tomato salad alongside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/05/dining/05KITCHEN4/05KITCHEN4-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "anchovy, eggplant, Parmesan, pecorino, provolone, smoked mozzarella, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 500}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 398, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "908 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Extra-virgin olive oil", "3 or 4 small eggplants (about 2 pounds), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices", "Salt and pepper", "Pinch of crushed red pepper", "1 small red onion, thinly sliced", "12 ounces fresh ricotta", "1/2 pound smoked mozzarella, thinly sliced (or use fresh mozzarella)", "2 cups provolone cheese, coarsely grated (about 1/2 pound)", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan or Grana Padano cheese (about 2 ounces)", "1/2 cup finely grated pecorino cheese (about 2 ounces)", "12 anchovy fillets", "1/4 cup toasted bread crumbs, preferably homemade", "1 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Sicilian"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
