{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Israeli Couscous, Bean and Tomato Salad", "description": "Finely chopped tomatoes seasoned with garlic, balsamic vinegar and basil serve as both dressing and vegetable in this main dish salad.\n\nI\u2019ve been making tomato concass\u00e9e all summer and using it as a sauce for pasta and fish. I decided to use it as a stand-in for salad dressing in this hearty salad, a simple combination of cooked Israeli couscous and beans. I used canned pinto beans, and they were just fine. Chickpeas would also work. Use lots of basil in the mix. The red onion contributes some crunch. You can add a little celery if you want more texture. Make sure to use sweet, ripe, juicy tomatoes. I love the finishing touch of the feta, but it is optional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/02/science/03recipehealth/03recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 generously", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, summer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 256}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 753, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "129 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "21 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1135 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound ripe, sweet tomatoes, finely chopped (about 1 1/3 cups chopped)", "1 plump garlic clove, pur\u00e9epureed with a little salt or put through a press", "Salt to taste", "2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar (more to taste)", "3 tablespoons extra- virgin olive oil", "2 cups cooked pinto beans (or other beans of your choice) (if using canned beans, drain and rinse)", "2 cups cooked Israeli couscous", "1/2 to 2/3 cup chopped red onion", "1/3 cup chopped fresh basil", "3 tablespoons chopped chives", "Freshly ground pepper", "Romaine lettuce leaves for serving", "Feta cheese for topping (about 1/2 cup, optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine finely chopped tomatoes, garlic, salt, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil.
