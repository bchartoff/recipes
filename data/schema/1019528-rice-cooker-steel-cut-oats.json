Steel-cut oats soften in the machine while retaining their nutty flavor and nubby chew \u2014 all without any effort on your part. Since rice cooker models vary, you can play around with the water proportions to achieve your favorite consistency. Generally, though, you\u2019ll need a lot more water to oats using a rice cooker because oats stiffen and soak up even more water as they rest after cooking. Once they\u2019re done, you can top them however you like, but regardless of whether you prefer your oats sweet or savory, be sure to cook them with salt to enhance their flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/dining/ko-rice-cooker-oats-horizontal/ko-rice-cooker-oats-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, grains and rice", "keywords": "main course, steel-cut oats, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 143}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup steel-cut oats", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "Savory toppings: saut\u00e9ed or roasted vegetables; crisped bacon, sausage or ham; flaked smoked fish; cooked eggs; kimchi; pickles; nori; roasted salted nuts or seeds; avocado; fresh tomatoes; fresh greens or herbs", "Sweet toppings: toasted nuts or seeds; dried fruit; fresh fruit; maple syrup; brown sugar; honey; jam; fruit compotes; milk or cream; nut butters"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the oats and salt in a rice cooker.
