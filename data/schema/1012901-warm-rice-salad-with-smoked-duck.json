Or, if you are feeling ambitious, remove the peels with a chef\u2019s knife and carve the sections away from the membranes with a paring knife, creating naked little crescents. If you do this, squeeze the juice from the membranes and from any peel pieces with bits of orange still attached into the vinegar and shallots. Add all the spices to the vinegar, and then the olive oil, stirring it quasi-energetically with a fork. Taste for salt; the dressing should be highly seasoned."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "As the rice is draining, heat the duck breast in the microwave just long enough to warm it but not long enough to cook it, around a minute or so. (Microwaves are idiosyncratic, so you be the judge.) Slice it into strips about half an inch thick, and slice those strips again into bits about half an inch thick. Toss the duck into a bowl with the rice and the olives. Add the dressing and stir well. Adjust the seasoning. Turn the rice salad onto a platter. Scatter the oranges over the top and dust the platter with the cilantro."}]}
