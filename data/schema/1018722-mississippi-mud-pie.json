They can have one layer, or five, and include ice cream or meringue, a flourless cake, nuts, fudge sauce and even brownie. This version, inspired by the towering beauty made by Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito of Baked in Brooklyn and written about in their book, \"Baked Explorations,\" features a graham cracker base, a dense brownie, chocolate custard and whipped cream. Needless to say, a little goes a long way. Share it with 16 to 32 of your closest friends. And a tip for serving: To ensure a clean release, give the underside and sides of the cake pan a 10-second blast with a hairdryer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/11/dining/11COOKING-MISSISSIPPI-MUD-PIE2/11COOKING-MISSISSIPPI-MUD-PIE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, graham cracker, dessert, nut-free, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 274}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 15 whole graham crackers", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "8 tablespoons/114 grams (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted", "8 tablespoons/114 grams (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "6 ounces/170 grams bittersweet chocolate, chopped", "1/3 cup/67 grams dark brown sugar", "1/3 cup/33 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder, plus more for dusting", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 large eggs, separated", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/32 grams all-purpose flour", "4 ounces/113 grams bittersweet chocolate, chopped", "2 tablespoons/29 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup/25 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "1/4 cup/28 grams cornstarch", "2 cups/480 milliliters whole milk", "4 large egg yolks", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters cold heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.

While mixing, gradually add the granulated sugar in a steady stream. Increase the mixer speed to high and continue to beat until you have stiff peaks, about 3 minutes. Using a large rubber spatula, fold the egg-white mixture evenly into the chocolate mixture. Sift the flour evenly over the chocolate mixture and fold it in. Transfer the batter to the prepared crust and smooth the top. Bake until a crust has formed over the top, the center is just set and a toothpick inserted 1 inch from the edges comes out with moist crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes. The center of the cake, under the crust, should still be very moist and fudgy. (Peek under the crust if necessary.) Do not overbake. The cake will sink slightly as it cools.

Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it has thickened and just come to a low boil. Continue to cook the custard, whisking, for another minute, then immediately pour it into the sieve, pushing it through with a small spatula. Let the custard stand for 1 minute, then whisk it together with the butter and chocolate until smooth. Pour the custard over the cooled cake. Cover the custard with plastic wrap or wax paper, making sure to press it gently into the surface of the custard.
