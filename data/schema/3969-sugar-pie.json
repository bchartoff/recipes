In his role managing the meals of the performers, he often had to scramble to find ingredients like Canadian maple syrup for the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in the troupe, who expected it on or in everything from pancakes to maple mousse pie. Mr. Comeau thought Vermont maple syrup is just as good, \"but try explaining it to them,\" he said. \"The contortionists, it's like wine to them. They'll taste it and know right away if it's not from Quebec.\" This sugar pie, sweetened with brown sugar and sweetened condensed milk, tastes like pure butterscotch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Leigh Cowan"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "canadian, french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, dessert, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 744, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "96 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "220 milligrams", "sugarContent": "62 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 3/4 cups flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 pound lard, cut into small pieces and chilled", "1/2 cup ice water", "1 1/2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces and chilled", "2 cups brown sugar", "14 ounces sweetened condensed milk", "1 tablespoon flour", "1 tablespoon butter, softened"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the crust, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.
