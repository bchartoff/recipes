He dissects the four main culinary regions of the country into manageable bites, and develops recipes that are simple to make but have complex flavors. In this recipe for puli jingha, he marries shrimp and coconut milk spiked with sambhar masala, a spice blend common in southern Indian kitchens. Nearly every household has its own version, and <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018036-sambhar-masala\">you can make the one he grew up with</a> quite easily. Serve this curry over lime-scented rice or yellow split peas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/30/dining/30SPICE3/30SPICE3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "curries", "keywords": "coconut milk, curry leaves, shrimp, tamarind, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 452}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 206, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "648 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018036-sambhar-masala\">sambhar masala</a> or garam masala", "1 teaspoon coarse sea or kosher salt", "1 teaspoon tamarind paste or concentrate", "1 pound large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), preferably live-caught in U.S., peeled and deveined but tails left on", "2 tablespoons coconut oil or vegetable oil", "1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk", "12 medium-size to large fresh curry leaves", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine masala, salt and tamarind paste in a medium bowl.
