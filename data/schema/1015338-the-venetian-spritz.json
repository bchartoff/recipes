It is a graceful way to begin an evening, and a thing of perfection on a sultry afternoon. The spritz can be made several ways, but the best and most common is simply a glass of prosecco with two or three ice cubes and a dash of sparkling water, topped with Aperol, a twist of lemon or slice of orange and \u2014 importantly and strangely \u2014 one green olive. The drink also can be made with white wine and sparkling water, and Campari or Cynar turn up in some varieties, but the spritz a l\u2019Aperol is the benchmark, and handily trumps the others.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Toby Cecchini"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, cocktails", "keywords": "aperol, orange, prosecco", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces prosecco", "Sparkling water", "1 1/2 to 2 ounces Aperol", "Orange", "Lemon", "1 green olive"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a rocks glass over three or four ice cubes, pour the prosecco, a dash of sparkling water and the Aperol, being sure to follow that order lest the Aperol sink to the bottom without mixing.
