But if, like me, you sometimes crave what amounts to savory pie filling without the hassle of making an actual crust, this is the way to go. Once you take the crust out of the quiche you not only radically alter the concept but expand its possibilities. You can produce a \u201cquiche\u201d Lorraine by softening onions (lots) in butter or bacon fat, then adding eggs, cooked bacon and cream or half-and-half, and baking it all as you do in the recipe here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/07/dining/crustless-quiche/crustless-quiche-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "cream, egg, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 960}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 153, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "245 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup cream, half-and-half, milk or a combination, gently heated just until warm", "3 eggs, at room temperature", "3/4 cup grated Emmenthal, Gruy\u00e8re, Cantal or a combination", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan or hard pecorino", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste", "Butter as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees and set rack in middle of it.
