Most supermarkets and butchers carry already-boned leg of lamb, and if they don\u2019t they\u2019re capable of doing it for you quickly. Toss on the persillade and fold one half of the meat on top of the other. Then roast it. The persillade stays put and flavors the meat beautifully. You won't serve a prestigious cut, but you'll serve a meaty, great-tasting one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/persillade-still/persillade-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "gluten-free, lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 243}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 374, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "438 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butterflied leg of lamb, 3 to 4 pounds", "2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil", "4 cups parsley leaves", "1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves or 1 teaspoon dried rosemary", "3 to 4 cloves garlic", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "Lemon wedges for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
