{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Greek Shrimp With Tomatoes and Feta", "description": "This traditional Greek recipe disregards the notion that seafood and cheese don\u2019t mix, and it works beautifully, resulting in a harmonious balance of flavors. Though it can be made year round with canned tomatoes, it is sensational with fresh sweet ripe ones, so best prepared in summer. Serve it as a main course with rice or potatoes, or in small portions as an appetizer, taverna-style.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/dining/31COOKING-GREEK-SHRIMP1/31COOKING-GREEK-SHRIMP1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, feta, shrimp, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1947}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 233, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "829 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Extra-virgin olive oil", "3 large shallots, diced, about 1 cup", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "Salt and pepper", "2 pounds large ripe tomatoes", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes", "1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined", "4 ounces Greek feta cheese", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put 4 tablespoons olive oil in a wide skillet over medium heat.
