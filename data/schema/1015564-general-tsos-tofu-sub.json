Take General Tso\u2019s Tofu Sub, a brilliant study of layered textures and flavors. The centerpiece is a deep-fried panko-crusted rectangle of firm tofu, golden and crusty outside, and creamy inside. Mr. Kord layers the tofu between edamame pur\u00e9e, homemade pickled cucumbers and a piquant sauce named after General Tso that includes ginger, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar and chilis. The blender does the work, in three quick steps. The result is startling. It is what Mr. Kord wants it to be: crunchy, creamy, salty, sweet and sour, all in one bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elaine Louie"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, sandwiches", "keywords": "ginger, soy sauce, tofu, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 115}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small chunk of ginger, 1 1/2 inches long, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 clove garlic, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons sweet soy sauce", "2 tablespoons white vinegar", "2 tablespoons mirin", "1/2 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 1/2 small red dry Chinese chilis", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum, optional", "2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped", "1 small chunk ginger, 1 inch long, peeled and sliced against the grain", "Half a shallot, roughly chopped", "1/4 teaspoon sesame oil", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "1 small red dry Chinese chili, seeded", "1/2 cup white wine vinegar", "1 scallion, in three-inch lengths, sliced vertically into chiffonade", "1 1/2 cucumbers, peeled, seeded, and sliced crosswise 1/8-inch thick", "3/4 cup frozen, shelled edamame, thawed", "Vegetable oil, for deep frying", "1/4 cup salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons sugar", "1/4 teaspoon paprika", "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon onion powder", "8 ounces firm tofu, drained and cut into 4 slices", "3 large egg whites", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "2 subway (submarine) sandwich rolls", "Mayonnaise", "Sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the General Tso sauce: In a blender combine ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sweet soy sauce, vinegar, mirin, and sesame oil.
