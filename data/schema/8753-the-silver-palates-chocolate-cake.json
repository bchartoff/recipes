{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Silver Palate\u2019s Chocolate Cake", "description": "This recipe is adapted from \u201cThe Silver Palate Cookbook,\u201d written by Sheila Lukins and Julee Rosso, who through their store in Manhattan, the Silver Palate, introduced bisteeya and poppy-seed dressing to the Upper West Side. For many, their cookbook, originally published in 1982, was a book of revelations: even if you hadn\u2019t mastered the art of French cooking, a meal of chicken Marbella and an indulgent dessert, cooked with confidence, was not beyond your grasp. Enter this decadent chocolate cake, whose title belies its incredible simplicity. The ingredients take hardly any time to whip together, and it bakes in a tube pan for under an hour. Gild it with a gooey chocolate frosting, and feed it to those you love with good cheer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christine Muhlke"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/23/dining/recipes-decadentchocolatecake/recipes-decadentchocolatecake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chocolate, vanilla, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1657}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 472, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "158 milligrams", "sugarContent": "48 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing pan", "1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra for flouring the pan", "3 ounces unsweetened chocolate", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups sugar", "2 eggs, separated", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips", "6 tablespoons heavy cream", "1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
