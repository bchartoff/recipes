He tells me it is an especially good one to make at home, because so many of us have old jars of sauerkraut cowering in the backs of our refrigerators. If my own refrigerator is any gauge, he is correct.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/15/magazine/15eat2/15mag-15eat-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beet, horseradish, sauerkraut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 or 5 large beets (about 1 3/4 pounds)", "Salt to taste", "1 large fennel bulb, or 2 or 3 smaller bulbs", "1 large yellow onion", "8 or 9 cloves garlic", "1/2 pound green or savoy cabbage", "Olive oil", "1 1/2 cups sauerkraut, preferably red sauerkraut, because it looks better", "1 cup sauerkraut liquid", "Red-wine vinegar", "A handful of mushroom butts, tied in cheesecloth or a coffee filter (optional)", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 small piece fresh horseradish, peeled", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375.
