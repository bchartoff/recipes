Simplest device is a teaspoon: to use it, stand next to boiling pot with bowl of mixture in hand and flick small amounts of mixture (1/2 teaspoon, less if you have patience) into water. Alternatively, if you have colander with largish holes (1/8-inch or better) put mixture into it, perch it over boiling pot and force mixture through holes with rubber spatula. Best of all, if you have a flat tinned-steel shredder set select the \"sled\" with 1/2-inch openings, hold it upside down over the pot (using pliers or a pair of vise-grips), put some mixture in sled and, using a pancake turner, force it through holes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook 10 to 15 minutes or until done as desired.
