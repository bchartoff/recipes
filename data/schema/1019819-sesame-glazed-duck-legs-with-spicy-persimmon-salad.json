{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame-Glazed Duck Legs With Spicy Persimmon Salad", "description": "Some Chinese cookbooks recommend steaming duck to tender perfection before roasting it to crisp the skin. It is a good technique to master, and works especially well with large moulard duck legs. You get moist tender duck, and a bonus pot full of rendered duck fat. (You can steam the duck up to 6 hours in advance of roasting it.) The accompanying salad of persimmons, oranges, pomegranate and daikon radish gets a kick from Serrano chile, lime juice, freshly grated ginger and sesame oil. Be sure to use Fuyu persimmons, which can be eaten unripe. (The long, pointy Hachiya persimmon must be completely ripe to be palatable.) It\u2019s worth mixing up a batch of fragrant, flavorful Sichuan pepper salt, both for this recipe and to have a little extra on hand to use as an all-purpose seasoning; if you can\u2019t find Sichuan peppercorns in a store, online spice merchants will have them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/12/dining/12kitchrex1/merlin_147153477_bbde9239-c811-43a0-9c3c-bee9e3572de2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "duck leg, persimmon, sichuan peppercorns, star anise, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 57}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 302, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "421 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns", "3 tablespoons flaky salt", "6 duck legs (about 5 pounds), preferably moulard duck, trimmed of excess fat", "2 or 3 cinnamon sticks, lightly crushed", "12 star anise pods, lightly crushed", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, for garnish", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "1 teaspoon Chinese spicy fermented bean paste (doubanjiang)", "3 tablespoons brown sugar", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice", "4 small Fuyu persimmons, peeled and cut in wedges", "2 navel oranges, peeled and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch rounds", "1 cup peeled and thinly sliced daikon radish or watermelon radish\u00a0", "1 or 2 Serrano chiles, to taste, seeded if you like and very thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "1 teaspoon finely grated ginger", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil", "Salt and pepper", "3/4 cup pomegranate seeds", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions", "1 bunch cilantro, top sprigs only, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make Sichuan pepper salt: Put Sichuan peppercorns and salt in a dry small skillet over medium-high heat.
