{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Lasagna", "description": "This classic vegan lasagna replaces ricotta with a homemade cashew-tofu cream that is easy to prepare and strikes the right balance: Cashews provide richness while tofu keeps things light. This recipe can be modified to fit your schedule. If you\u2019re in a hurry, forgo the sauce for three cups of your favorite store-bought marinara, and if you prefer no-boil noodles, they work, too. You could replace the cashew-tofu cream with purchased vegan ricotta, or get ahead on future dinners by doubling the cashew-tofu ricotta and freezing the extra batch. It keeps for up to six weeks in the freezer, and can also be used in stuffed shells and manicotti.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gena Hamshaw"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/09/dining/gh-vegan-lasagna/merlin_170017074_223a2161-e4da-45e6-a390-58247bef06dd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, noodles, pastas", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, cashew, crushed canned tomatoes, ricotta, tofu, tomato, tomato sauce, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 small white or yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (or 1 teaspoon dried oregano)", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes with their juices", "1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1 tablespoon vegan sugar (optional)", "Kosher salt, to taste", "2 cups raw cashews", "1 small garlic clove", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 (15-ounce) block extra-firm tofu, lightly pressed between paper towels to remove excess moisture", "2 tablespoons nutritional yeast", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Olive oil, for greasing", "Kosher salt", "9 to 12 uncooked lasagna noodles", "Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinara sauce: Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium-high.
