Each time you take a piece of phyllo from the pile, replace the towels so that the phyllo doesn\u2019t dry out. Place a sheet of parchment on your work surface horizontally, with the long edge close to you. Take a sheet of phyllo from the pile and lay it on the parchment. Brush the first sheet of phyllo lightly with the butter and olive oil mixture and top with the next sheet. Continue to layer all eight sheets, brushing each one before topping with the next one.

Fold the bottom edge of the phyllo up over the filling, then fold the ends over and roll up like a burrito. Using the parchment paper to help you lift the strudel, place both the parchment paper and the strudel on a baking sheet with the seam side down. Brush with butter and olive oil and make 3 or 4 slits on the diagonal along the length of the strudel.

Remove from the oven, brush again with the butter and olive oil, rotate the pan and return to the oven. Continue to bake for another 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for at least 20 minutes and preferably for 30. Serve warm. Reheat in a medium (325 degrees) oven if the strudel loses its crispiness before you are ready to serve. It will crisp up in about 10 minutes."}]}
