{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seaweed Salad", "description": "Seaweed comes in many forms, and is used extensively in Japanese cuisine. Most of us are familiar with the pressed sheets of nori that are wrapped around sushi, and kombu, the dark green algae that is simmered to make classic dashi broth. Japanese groceries have a dizzying array of salt-packed specialty varieties, but many supermarkets and health-food stores sell packages of dried seaweed, which may be the most user-friendly. Two types that are commonly available are reddish-purple dulse and bright green wakame. Both simply need bathing in cold water for a few minutes to soften and ready them for use. Once soaked and drained, the seaweed is tossed with a simple traditional dressing of sesame oil with ginger and soy. My version makes a fine vegetarian meal, with thin slices of carrot, radish, cucumber and daikon, along with avocado, green onion, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/18/dining/18KITCH_SPAN/18KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "cucumber, radish, seaweed, dairy-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 115}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 170, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "463 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce dried red dulse seaweed", "1 ounce dried green wakame seaweed", "2 tablespoons rice-wine vinegar", "2 teaspoons sugar", "2 teaspoons grated ginger", "1/2 teaspoon wasabi powder", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon roasted sesame oil", "Juice of 1 lime", "Sea salt, to taste", "1 small carrot, peeled and sliced paper-thin", "4 red radishes, thinly sliced", "2 ounces daikon radish, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 small cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 firm-ripe avocado, sliced", "1 teaspoon toasted white sesame seeds", "1 teaspoon toasted black sesame seeds", "2 teaspoons toasted pumpkin seeds", "4 green onions, slivered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the dulse and wakame in a large bowl and cover with cold water.
