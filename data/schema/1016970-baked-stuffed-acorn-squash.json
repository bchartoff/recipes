{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Stuffed Acorn Squash", "description": "This makes a substantial vegetarian \u2013 or vegan if you leave out the cheese \u2013 Thanksgiving main dish. It is another riff on the native American tradition of the Three Sisters \u2013 corn, beans, and squash. I used acorn squash here, and it serves as a vessel for the sweet and pungent bean, corn and tomato filling. Acorn squash comes in various sizes; the larger ones, which are sometimes all I can find, take almost an hour to soften and cook through; the finished squash can be cut in half or even into thirds if too big for one serving. With everything that comes on the Thanksgiving sideboard, that will probably be the case. I always bake the squash for about 20 minutes before cutting it in half; they soften up a little bit, which makes it much easier to cut.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/10/health/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 substantial main dish servings, 12 to 16 smaller servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 357}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 513, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "90 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "18 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1088 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large or 6 smaller acorn squash", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for basting", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1 red pepper, diced", "1 28-ounce can chopped tomatoes with juice, pulsed to a coarse pur\u00e9e in a food processor", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 tablespoons mild honey, maple syrup or pomegranate molasses", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, sherry vinegar or apple cider vinegar", "Salt to taste", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne", "3 cups cooked pintos, black beans or red beans, or 2 cans, drained and rinsed", "1 cup corn kernels", "2/3 cup breadcrumbs", "2 ounces / 1/2 cup Gruy\u00e8re, grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
