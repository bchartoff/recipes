{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Frosty Lime Pie", "description": "This frozen dessert delivers cold, tart relief on a hot summer day. Pearl Byrd Foster served this pie on her menu at Mr. and Mrs. Foster\u2019s Place, her 15-table restaurant on the Upper East Side. Ms. Foster opened the restaurant after a 30-year career in hotel, department store and food magazine kitchens. Raymond Sokolov, a former food editor of The New York Times, wrote about this recipe in 1971. The real secret to making this pie, he said, is in how you handle the egg yolks. Heat them too much and they scramble, or too little and they won\u2019t thicken. When the yolks get too hot for your finger, around 165 degrees, they\u2019re hot enough.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/dining/23COOKING-FROSTY-LIME-PIE1/23COOKING-FROSTY-LIME-PIE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice dishes, pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 154}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 312, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "180 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs", "1/4 cup superfine sugar", "Pinch of salt", "1/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature", "5 eggs, separated", "3/4 cup superfine sugar, divided", "2/3 cup fresh squeezed, strained lime juice", "2 teaspoons grated lime zest", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream, whipped", "Thin slices of lime or fresh strawberries", "Sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Place the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt in a bowl.
