This is \u201cpretty close to a traditional Cajun crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e,\u201d said Mr. Knott. \u201cIf you substitute a green bell pepper for the chile and omit the dried thyme, you would be cooking one exactly like my grandmother used to make. Some people like to stir in the juice from half of a lemon into the pan just prior to serving.\u201d Look for precooked Louisiana crawfish tails in 1-pound packages in your fishmonger\u2019s freezer section. Though according to Mr. Knott, who gets his crawfish from the family pond behind his brewery, the best tasting version is made with leftovers from a crawfish boil \u2014 that way you have lots of leftover crawfish fat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/22/dining/22JPBAYOU6/22JPBAYOU6-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "crawfish, poblano chili, rice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 678, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "57 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "750 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sticks unsalted butter", "1 diced onion", "1 seeded and diced poblano chile pepper", "3 celery stalks, diced", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "2 pounds frozen precooked crawfish tails, thawed in their packages", "1/2 cup diced green onions", "1/2 cup diced parsley leaves", "2 cups medium-grain rice", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon salt", "2 to 3 bay leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the \u00e9touff\u00e9e: In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat.
