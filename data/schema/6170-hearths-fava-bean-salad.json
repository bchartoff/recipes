Shell the beans and parboil for 30 to 40 seconds. Plunge the favas into ice water to stop the cooking. Pop each bean out of its outer skin by pinching with thumb and forefinger; you may have to slit the outer skin with a knife if the beans are mature. (You should have about 4 cups.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, combine the favas with the onions. Season lightly with salt and generously with pepper.

Adjust seasoning to taste. Serve with crusty bread. Be sure to spoon on extra oil for soaking up with the bread."}]}
