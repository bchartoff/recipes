{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Avocado Tacos", "description": "Most top chefs will tell you the same thing: When they finally escape from the elaborate labors they oversee in the kitchen, they crave late-night street food that\u2019s poetically simple and satisfying: hot dogs, fried rice, a bowl of noodles. For Enrique Olvera, the chef at Cosme in New York and Pujol in Mexico City, that hand-to-mouth haiku can be found in avocado tacos, which he scarfs down around the clock. They serve as both \u201ca comfort,\u201d he said, and \u201ca cultural expression.\u201d In its most basic form, an avocado taco is like a two-bite couplet in praise of Mexican ingredients: a chewy corn tortilla enclosing creamy slices of the-butter-that-grows-on-trees. Spare additions elevate that avocado: a pinch of salt, a spray of lime juice, a sprinkle of chopped onions and cilantro. But the chef takes elevation one step further with a salsa made of pasilla chiles and tomatillos.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/03/dining/03OLVSIDE/03OLVSIDE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 tacos", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, tacos", "keywords": "avocado, corn tortillas, garlic, pasilla chile, tomatillo, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 384}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "94 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pasilla chiles", "1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt", "2 garlic cloves", "10 tomatillos, boiled in salted water for 15 minutes or until soft", "3 avocados, sliced thin", "12 corn tortillas", "3/4 cup white onion, finely diced", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the salsa: Snap the stems off the chiles and remove the seeds.
