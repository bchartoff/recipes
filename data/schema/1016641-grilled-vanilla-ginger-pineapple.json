{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Vanilla-Ginger Pineapple", "description": "Sherry Yard has a wonderful recipe in her first cookbook, \u201cThe Secrets of Baking,\u201d called Roasted Voodoo Vanilla Pineapple. She roasts her pineapple with the dried vanilla pods that you save after you\u2019ve scraped out the seeds, and fresh ginger. She inserts the pods into the flesh of the pineapple, a great idea if you\u2019re roasting the pineapple for a long time. \nI decided to use vanilla extract instead of the pods, because during the relatively short time on the grill they infused only the section of the pineapple they had been stuck into. I add vanilla to the ginger syrup and baste the pineapple with this sweet and pungent mix. You could also simply drizzle the pineapple with honey.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/08/science/07recipehealth/07recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 79}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 238, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "17 milligrams", "sugarContent": "28 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large ripe pineapple", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 cup ginger palm sugar syrup or honey", "Pinch of cayenne", "1 tablespoon grape seed oil or canola oil", "Fresh mint for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut ends off pineapple.
