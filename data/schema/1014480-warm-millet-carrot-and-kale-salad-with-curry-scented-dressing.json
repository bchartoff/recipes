{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warm Millet, Carrot and Kale Salad With Curry-Scented Dressing", "description": "I love millet but it is tricky to cook; it can easily turn to mush. I have found that cooking more than 2/3 cup at a time can be problematic because the millet at the bottom of the pot becomes gummy by the time all of the millet is cooked. But the tiny, nutritious seeds of grain expand so much during cooking that you don\u2019t need more than 2/3 of a cup for this recipe, and if you toast the seeds in a little oil first and take care not to stir the millet once you\u2019ve added the water you will get a fluffy result.

Add the millet and toast, stirring, until it begins to smell fragrant and toasty, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the 2 cups of kale water. If not using the kale water add 2 cups water and salt to taste, and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer 25 to 30 minutes, until the liquid in the saucepan has evaporated and the grains are fluffy. Turn off the heat, place a clean dish towel over the pot and return the lid. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then transfer the cooked millet to a baking sheet or a shallow pan and spread out in an even layer to cool.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Make sure that your kale leaves are dry. Tear them into medium-size pieces and toss with the olive oil. Gently knead the leaves between your thumbs and fingers to make sure they are coated with oil. Place in an even layer on the baking sheets. Do this in batches if necessary. Place in the oven and roast for 22 to 25 minutes, until the leaves are crisp but not browned. If some of the leaves crisp before others, remove them to a bowl or sheet pan and return the remaining kale to the oven. Watch closely as once the kale browns it will taste bitter. Once the kale is crisp, season to taste with salt.
