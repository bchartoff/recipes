{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach Artichoke Dip", "description": "Spinach artichoke dip has a way of inciting controversy. Should it be served cold or hot? Is it lowbrow or classic? Should it be served in a bread bowl or with tortilla chips? Well, the good news is that there are no wrong answers here, only delicious, creamy dip. This particular one is best served hot (or at least room temperature), but it is also acceptable to spread it on crackers after being chilled. And with the inclusion of fresh spinach, it could almost be described as classy. Use canned artichoke hearts; they've got a tangier flavor and better texture than the frozen ones. If you want to go a step further, transfer it to a skillet and run it under the broiler after cooking, which gives you bubbling dip with a golden top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/26/dining/26COOKING-SPINACH-ARTICHOKE-DIP1/22COOKING-SPINACH-ARTICHOKE-DIP1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, artichoke hearts, cream cheese, mozzarella, pecorino, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1737}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 396, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "586 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large garlic clove, finely chopped", "1 12-ounce bunch fresh spinach, finely chopped (or 1 10-ounce package frozen spinach, defrosted, drained and finely chopped)", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 (14-ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, drained and coarsely chopped", "8 ounces cream cheese, cut into 1-inch pieces", "4 ounces fresh mozzarella, torn or shredded", "4 ounces sour cream or full-fat Greek yogurt", "1/4 cup Pecorino Romano or Parmesan, finely grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat.
