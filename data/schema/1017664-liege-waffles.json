With their buttery brioche consistency and pockets of sweet sticky sugar throughout, they're decidedly more dessert than breakfast. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find pearl sugar. Granulated sugar and water are all you need for a D.I.Y. version that yields excellent results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/26/dining/26CLOSE3/26CLOSE3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "16 waffles", "recipeCuisine": "belgian", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "main course, nonfat milk, pearl sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 160}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 219, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "150 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup (120 milliliters) nonfat milk", "2 tablespoons (25 grams) brown sugar", "2 1/4 teaspoons (7 grams) active dry yeast", "2 large eggs", "1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) vanilla extract", "3 2/3 cups (460 grams) all-purpose flour, divided", "1 teaspoon (6 grams) coarse or kosher salt", "7 tablespoons (100 grams) butter, softened", "1 cup pearl sugar, or make your own (see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the milk and 1/4 cup (60 milliliters)\u00a0water in a small saucepan and heat until lukewarm, 110 to 116 degrees on an instant-read thermometer.
