They come seasoned and self-contained, with no need for condiments or sauces. After a long trip, you just throw them on the grill or under a broiler, and serve with a salad on the side. Or, even better, toss them into your salad (in this case, a lightly grilled radicchio salad), letting their fat flavor the leaves along with the lemon juice and good olive oil you also packed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/10/dining/10APPE_SPAN/10APPE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 145}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 926, "unsaturatedFatContent": "52 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "83 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "sodiumContent": "1690 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large heads radicchio, about 10 ounces each", "3 to 4 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "2 pounds sweet or hot Italian sausages", "1 lemon, halved", "Basil leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light or heat up the grill.
