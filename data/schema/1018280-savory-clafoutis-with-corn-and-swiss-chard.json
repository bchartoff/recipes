{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Savory Clafoutis With Corn and Swiss Chard", "description": "Clafoutis are\u00a0baked French pancakes, usually filled with sweet cherries. This savory version calls for corn, Swiss chard and leeks instead of fruit, and includes plenty of Gruy\u00e8re\u00a0for a salty depth. It will emerge from the oven puffed and golden, then quickly deflate. Fear not, it still tastes wonderful after it flattens out, though for the best presentation, try to time it so your guests are at the table when it\u00a0is ready. Serve it for brunch or a light dinner with a tomato salad on the side, if you\u2019re making this in tomato season. In winter, sliced oranges drizzled with olive oil and salt are nice, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/08/multimedia/clark-clafouti/clark-clafouti-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pancakes", "keywords": "corn, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, dill leaves, eggs, Gruy\u00e8re, leeks, Swiss chard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 251}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 533, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "850 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup whole milk", "3/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "4 large eggs", "2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill leaves", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, more as needed", "1 cup coarsely grated Gruy\u00e8re or Cheddar (about 4 ounces)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large or 3 small leeks (white and light green parts), halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "2 cups corn kernels (from 2 to 3 ears, or frozen and thawed)", "1 large garlic clove, grated on a Microplane or minced", "1 large bunch Swiss chard, stems removed, leaves coarsely chopped (8 cups)", "1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\u00a0", "Fresh lemon juice, for serving", "Red pepper flakes, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
