{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato Gratin With Swiss Chard and Sumac Onions", "description": "This is not your typical potato gratin: The Cheddar and brown-butter pine nuts make it rich but not overly so, as the sumac onions and lemon juice lift the gratin to vibrant heights. Sumac is a tart and astringent spice used heavily in Middle Eastern cooking, adding sharpness to food where needed. These onions are great thrown into pasta and salads, or served with roasted chicken. The gratin can stand as a veggie main with a zesty salad alongside, as an accompaniment to your protein of choice or as part of a larger spread. Get ahead by making the onions and preparing all your ingredients (except the potatoes) well in advance, so they\u2019re ready to be assembled together before baking. Once the whole thing goes in the oven, you\u2019ll have ample time to get any accompaniments ready. You can serve this warm, but it also sits well to be served at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/18/dining/14ottorex/14ottorex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "cheddar, lemon, onion, parsley, sumac, swiss chard, yukon gold potato, main course, side dish, spring, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 44}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup/60 milliliters olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds/680 grams red onions, peeled, halved and sliced about 1-centimeter thick", "Kosher salt", "1 1/2 tablespoons dried sumac", "2 1/2 pounds/1.1 kilograms (skin-on) Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced using a mandoline or very thinly sliced into rounds", "1 3/4 pounds/800 grams green Swiss chard, leaves torn from stems (stems reserved for another use) and roughly shredded (about 6 packed cups/315 grams)", "2/3 cup/30 grams roughly chopped fresh parsley, plus 2 tablespoons/5 grams finely chopped parsley for garnish", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest, plus 1/4 cup juice (from 2 lemons)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "8 ounces/225 grams mature Cheddar, roughly grated (about 3 cups)", "1 cup/240 milliliters chicken or vegetable stock", "3 tablespoons heavy cream (double cream)", "2 tablespoons/30 grams unsalted butter", "1/2 cup/65 grams pine nuts", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit/180 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the onions: Add the oil to a large, ovenproof lidded skillet and heat over medium-high.
