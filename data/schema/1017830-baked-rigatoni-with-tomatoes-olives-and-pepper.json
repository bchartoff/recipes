{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Rigatoni With Tomatoes, Olives and Pepper", "description": "This baked rigatoni is a grown-up version of macaroni and cheese. The tomato sauce, judiciously spiced with hot red pepper flakes and embellished with diced bright yellow bell pepper and pungent black olives, is easy and straightforward. It keeps for three or four days in the refrigerator, so you can make it ahead, or you can toss it right away with the al dente rigatoni and cheese. Spread the mixture in an oiled baking dish, cover it well and refrigerate. It will be fine there for a day, ready to transfer to the oven when the hungry troops begin to ask what\u2019s for dinner. Bake the rigatoni until bubbly, make a green salad to serve alongside and everybody will be happy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/dining/mrs-baked-rigatoni/mrs-baked-rigatoni-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "gruy\u00e8re, olives, rigatoni, tomato, yellow bell pepper, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 740}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 469, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "641 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (28-ounce) can tomatoes, whole or diced, with juice", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for oiling baking dish", "1 large sweet yellow pepper, cut in 1/2-inch dice", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/8 teaspoon sugar", "Salt", "1/3 cup kalamata olives, pitted and halved", "Black pepper", "2 tablespoons slivered fresh basil (optional)", "1 pound rigatoni", "3 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, grated (3/4 cup)", "1 ounce Parmesan (optional), grated (1/4 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pulse tomatoes with juice in a food processor to a coarse pur\u00e9e.
