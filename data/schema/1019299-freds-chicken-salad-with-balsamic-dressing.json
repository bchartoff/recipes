{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Freds\u2019 Chicken Salad With Balsamic Dressing", "description": "This salad is a perennial favorite at Freds, the glittery see-and-be-seen restaurant inside Barneys New York. The recipe calls for a whole roasted chicken, so you'll need to build in time to allow one to cool after roasting, or you can use leftovers or a store-bought rotisserie chicken instead. When prepping the vegetables and pear, make sure the pieces are more or less the same size. And remember to sprinkle the pear with lemon juice to keep it from discoloring, and cut the avocado just before serving. Precision never goes out of fashion.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ginia Bellafante"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/dining/freds-chicken-salad-2/merlin_154604952_2850809e-a325-495b-ad7b-a48102eeff6e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 main-course servings, or 6 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, avocado, chicken, mixed greens, pear", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1166}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 4-pound chicken (or a store-bought rotisserie chicken, in which case skip to the dressing below)", "1 1/2 tablespoons salt", "1/2 bunch fresh thyme", "1 lemon, quartered", "2 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/4 cup balsamic vinegar", "1/4 cup Dijon mustard", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons sugar (optional)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup fresh pears diced in 1-inch pieces", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "4 large handfuls mixed greens, such as a boxed mix with fresh herbs", "1 cup string beans cut in 1-inch pieces, blanched\u00a0(from about 1/4 pound beans; see note)", "1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved", "1/2 cup minced onion", "2 ripe avocados, cut into 1-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Roast the chicken (if you\u2019re using a cooked, store-bought chicken, skip this step): Heat oven to 350 degrees.
