Her background is Filipino, and Mr. Phojanakong\u2019s recipe for chicken wings is a spin on something that his mother used to cook every week for her family when the chef was a boy: a whole chicken simmered in a silky, peppery adobo gravy. In Mr. Phojanakong\u2019s version, that sauce gets extra creaminess from coconut milk. At Kuma Inn, the wings have become a signature dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/15/dining/15WINGSKUMA/15WINGSKUMA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods", "keywords": "bay leaves, chicken wings, garlic, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 178}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 746, "unsaturatedFatContent": "39 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "56 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "2869 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup rice vinegar", "3/4 cup soy sauce", "6 to 8 cloves garlic, crushed", "3/4 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "2 bay leaves", "2 1/2 pounds chicken wings, tips removed and sectioned", "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1/3 cup coconut milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaves.
