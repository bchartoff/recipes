{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Easiest Chicken Noodle Soup", "description": "The majority of shortcut chicken soup recipes use rotisserie chicken. It\u2019s a convenient hack, but cooked chicken doesn\u2019t absorb flavors very well. On the other hand, saut\u00e9ing ground chicken in olive oil with garlic, coriander and celery seeds (or fennel seeds and rosemary, or herbes de Provence) creates a deeply complex base. Add the vegetables, then the stock and the noodles for a complete meal that cooks in 30 minutes. You can use egg noodles, cavatelli or alphabet noodles, but you may want to adjust the amount of stock to taste, since they\u2019ll each absorb a different amount of liquid.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/23/dining/aw-easiest-chicken-noodle-soup/aw-easiest-chicken-noodle-soup-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "carrot, celery, celery seeds, chicken, coriander, garlic, noodles, shallot, thyme, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1084}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound ground chicken", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon celery seeds (optional)", "1 large carrot, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 celery stalks, halved lengthwise, then sliced 1/2-inch thick", "1 large shallot, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves)", "7 to 8 cups chicken stock, plus more as needed", "8 ounces dried egg noodles, cavatelli or other small shaped pasta", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, chopped fresh parsley and dill, and lemon zest, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high.
