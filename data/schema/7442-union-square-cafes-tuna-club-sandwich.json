{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Union Square Cafe's Tuna Club Sandwich", "description": "This update on a workaday sandwich takes time and work, it\u2019s true. But the result, Julia Reed says, is the best old-fashioned tuna salad sandwich you\u2019ve ever had in your life. You\u2019ll need one pound of yellowfin tuna, which you\u2019ll poach with aromatics, cool and then mix with a few chopped peppers, fennel seed, onion and herbs. If you plan ahead, you can make the tuna salad without the herbs, refrigerate it overnight, and add them in before assembling your sandwiches. Layer it on toasted bread with a lemon-pepper aioli, slab bacon and arugula. This is picnic food for the gods.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-TUNACLUB/19COOKING-TUNACLUB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fish, tuna, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 egg yolks", "1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 teaspoons red wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "2 teaspoons finely minced garlic", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups olive oil", "3/4 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped onion", "1/3 cup coarsely chopped carrot", "1/3 cup sliced celery", "1 bay leaf", "3 whole black peppercorns", "1 pound yellowfin tuna, skinless, cut into 2-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon fennel seeds", "2 tablespoons diced red bell pepper", "2 tablespoons diced yellow bell pepper", "1/4 cup minced red onion", "1 tablespoon julienned fresh basil leaves", "1 teaspoon finely chopped mint", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "Fresh lemon juice to taste", "12 slices sourdough, white or whole wheat bread, lightly toasted", "2 1/2 cups arugula, trimmed, washed and dried", "8 ( 1/4-inch-thick) slices slab bacon, cooked until crisp"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make aioli: Combine egg yolks, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, garlic and salt in a food processor.
