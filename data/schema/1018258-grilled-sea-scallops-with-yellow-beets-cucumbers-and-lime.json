{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Sea Scallops With Yellow Beets, Cucumbers and Lime", "description": "Here\u2019s a simple bright dish that\u2019s nearly effortless to put together. You make a sort of salad-like relish with onion, cucumber and golden beet, seasoned with ginger and lime juice. Once the scallops are grilled, you spoon the relish over and drizzle with fruity olive oil, along with a shower of chopped sweet herbs. Done and done. If sea scallops are not available, use wild shrimp or halibut or salmon fillets. It is best to cook and cool the beets in advance (even a day ahead).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/24/dining/24KITCHEN1/24KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "beet, cucumber, ginger, lime, onion, scallops, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 185}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 127, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "561 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium yellow beets", "1 1/2 pounds large dry-packed sea scallops (about 18 scallops)", "Salt and pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup finely diced red onion", "4 tablespoons lime juice, plus more for finishing", "1 teaspoon grated ginger", "2 medium cucumbers, peeled and diced into 1/2 inch cubes", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped dill", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint", "2 tablespoons finely cut chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
