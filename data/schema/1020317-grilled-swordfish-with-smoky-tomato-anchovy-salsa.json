{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Swordfish With Smoky Tomato-Anchovy Salsa", "description": "This is a simple summer fish dish with robust flavors. Swordfish would be the first choice, for its meatiness and ease of grilling, but any firm-fleshed white fish, such as halibut, monkfish, corvina or snapper, is a suitable option. Tuna would also work, but for that matter, so would chicken breast, for those at your gathering who don\u2019t eat fish. Topped with an easily made salsa of cherry tomatoes, anchovy, hot pepper and smoky piment\u00f3n, the whole affair is rather salad-like, best accompanied by arugula or lettuce leaves. Serve with roasted potatoes or garlic toast for a casual picnic-style summer supper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/03/dining/28kitchenrex/merlin_156916815_308c1d1d-1ed8-4ceb-86a4-ccd5abdb529d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "anchovies, swordfish, tomato, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 256}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (8-ounce) swordfish steaks,\u00a0cut \u00be-inch thick", "Salt and pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar, or to taste", "1 teaspoon smoked Spanish paprika (Piment\u00f3n de la Vera)", "1 teaspoon tomato paste", "2 small garlic cloves, smashed to a paste", "1 medium red onion, diced small (about 1 cup)", "1 sweet red pepper, diced (about 1 cup)", "2 Fresno chiles, seeds removed and finely diced", "4 anchovy fillets, chopped, plus 4 whole fillets for garnish", "2 cups halved cherry tomatoes in different colors", "Pinch of dried oregano", "Arugula leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal grill or heat a gas grill.
