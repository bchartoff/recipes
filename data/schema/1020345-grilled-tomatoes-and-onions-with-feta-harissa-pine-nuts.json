{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Tomatoes and Onions With Feta-Harissa Pine Nuts", "description": "This falls somewhere between a mezze salad, a sauce and a dip. It is rich and intense on its own but great as part of a meal with warm flatbreads, soft-boiled eggs and perhaps some labneh or thick yogurt on the side. Try to get your hands on the best-quality tomatoes you can find; the simplicity of this dish really lets the fresh vegetables sing. This is lovely eaten warm or at room temperature. It reheats quite well, its flavors intensifying as they sit overnight, and can be repurposed as a sauce spooned over grilled meats, couscous or pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/24/dining/22ottorex/merlin_158045637_203965ef-860a-460b-a41c-e2431d645cc5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, casseroles, dips and spreads, vegetables", "keywords": "cilantro, feta, harissa, plum tomato, red onion, fall, summer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 192}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons/75 milliliters olive oil", "1 pound/450 grams red onions, each peeled and cut through the core into 8 wedges", "2 red bell peppers (10 ounces/285 grams), seeded, stemmed and cut into 1-inch/3-centimeter pieces", "2 jalape\u00f1os, cut into 1/3-inch/1-centimeter-thick rounds,\u00a0stems discarded", "1 head garlic, halved horizontally, cloves split in half", "3 1/4 pounds/1 1/2 kilograms plum tomatoes", "1/2 cup/20 grams roughly chopped fresh cilantro (coriander), plus 1 tablespoon, for garnish", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "Kosher salt", "4 ounces/115 grams cherry tomatoes with the vine attached", "4 ounces/115 grams Greek feta, roughly crumbled into large chunks", "1/4 cup/25 grams pine nuts", "1/2 tablespoon harissa paste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit/245 degrees Celsius.
