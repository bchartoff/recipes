{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Polenta", "description": "For those who have sworn off mashed potatoes because of the carbohydrates and fats, and for those who cannot eat wheat and so have said good-bye to pasta, polenta may be just the thing. Polenta is a delicious gruel, an elegant mush made by cooking cornmeal (or occasionally semolina or buckwheat) in salted water. From humble origins, polenta now appears on the fanciest restaurant menus, usually served as an accompaniment to meat and fish. But it can be a main event. It can be served hot and runny from the pot, or else sliced, grilled, pan-seared or gratin\u00e9ed. And polenta can be topped with any number of sauces or vegetable ragouts.
