Ms. Madison is always inspiring, and I think this is her best book to date. These are chunkier than pancakes because of all the rice, but they are more cake than fritter. Let them rise on the griddle \u2013 don\u2019t press them down \u2013 and allow them to cook for 3 minutes on each side. I like to serve them with a dollop of tomato sauce. You can make smaller cakes to serve as hors d\u2019oeuvres or snacks.<br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/16/science/15recipehealth/15recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "24 about 2 1/2-inch cakes, serving 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "russian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "beet greens, brown rice, ricotta, halal, healthy, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 9}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 249, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "329 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound beet greens, or a mix of beet greens and other greens, such as chard or mustard greens, washed, stemmed and coarsely chopped (6 cups tightly packed)", "1 cup (8 ounces) ricotta cheese", "2 eggs, beaten", "1/2 cup low-fat milk (2 percent)", "5 tablespoons grated Parmesan", "1/2 cup whole-wheat pastry flour or white whole-wheat pastry flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 cup cooked brown or white rice, preferably medium- or short-grain", "2 tablespoons finely chopped chives", "2 teaspoons finely chopped marjoram", "Freshly ground pepper", "Olive oil for the pan or griddle", "Marinara sauce for serving (optional) "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam the greens above an inch of boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes, just until wilted.
