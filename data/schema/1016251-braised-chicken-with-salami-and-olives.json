{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Chicken With Salami and Olives", "description": "Donald Link pays homage to New Orleans\u2019 Sicilian roots with a dish that also appeals to his love of both salt and salami. The dish has the feel of chicken cacciatore, but its use of olives, salami and fennel brings more complexity. Mr. Link uses handmade salami from Cochon Butcher, his meat shop in New Orleans, but a hunk of good quality supermarket salami works fine. Jarred green olives would suffice in a pinch but they will make the dish extra salty and compromise its texture. Instead, find firm green olives such as Sicilian-cured Sevillanos or French Lucques or Picholine olives.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/16/dining/16COOKBOOK3/16COOKBOOK3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, southern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chicken, olives, salami, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 399}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 767, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "55 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "50 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1457 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) chicken, cut into 10 pieces", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, thinly sliced", "5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 fennel bulb, thinly sliced", "1 rosemary branch, about 8 inches", "1 1/4 cups diced salami (see note)", "1 cup pitted green olives, rinsed and cut in half (see note)", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 1/4 cups chicken broth", "4 bay leaves", "Juice of 1 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
