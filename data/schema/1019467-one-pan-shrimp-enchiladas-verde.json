{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Shrimp Enchiladas Verde", "description": "If the only thing holding you back from making enchilada verde tonight is the idea of standing over the countertop, stuffing and rolling tortillas, read on. These layered lasagna-style enchiladas cut your work in half. Instead, put all your effort into making a nearly effortless verde sauce with pan-roasted tomatillos, jalape\u00f1o and onion. Once that\u2019s done, there is little to do but layer and simmer: The shrimp cooks in minutes in the tomatillo bath. For the best flavor, look for wild-caught Gulf or Argentine shrimp. Then, the only challenge here is deciding how to portion fairly for four people (hint: be generous). If you make this in cast-iron, store any leftovers in glass or plastic in the fridge \u2014 the sauce is too acidic to spend a long time in a cast-iron pan \u2014 and reheat lightly over a very low flame. (Note, too, that the sauce can be made up to two days ahead, and refrigerated.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/dining/sc-One-Pan-Shrimp-Enchiladas-Verde/sc-One-Pan-Shrimp-Enchiladas-Verde-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 451}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 581, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1227 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons vegetable oil", "8 corn tortillas", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeds removed", "2 pounds tomatillos, husks removed (about 20 tomatillos)", "2 small red onions, peeled and sliced into rings", "1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves and stems, plus leaves for garnish", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt", "1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined and roughly chopped (patted dry if wet)", "6 ounces cotija or queso anejo, crumbled (about 1 1/2 cups)", "Mexican crema or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.
