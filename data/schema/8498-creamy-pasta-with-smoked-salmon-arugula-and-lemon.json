{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Pasta With Smoked Salmon, Arugula and Lemon", "description": "One selling point of smoked salmon is that you don't need to do much to it to get it on the table. Fold it on top of toast and dab it with sour cream and you have the lazy man's cocktail party. But take the salmon one or two steps further and you break out of the clich\u00e9. Salmon's buttery fat and smoke serve as useful flavoring elements. In this easy 15-minute meal, it's chopped up and used as a counterweight in pasta tossed with full-fat Greek yogurt, arugula, fresh dill, lemon zest and juice. It is, at once, lively and comforting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/06/dining/06COOKING-PASTASMOKEDSALMON2/06COOKING-PASTASMOKEDSALMON2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "greek yogurt, pasta, smoked salmon, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 478}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 454, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "558 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "3/4 pound casarecci, gemelli or gigli pasta", "1 cup Greek yogurt", "1/2 pound smoked salmon, cut into bite-size pieces", "1 clove garlic, smashed and chopped", "Zest and juice of 1 Meyer lemon (or a regular lemon)", "2 cups packed arugula", "1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill", "Coarsely ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salty water to a rolling boil.
