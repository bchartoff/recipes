To ward off blandness, she stocks her freezer in advance with flavor bombs: small, dark green ice blocks of garlic, ginger, cilantro, parsley and other ingredients, frozen in ice cube trays. When the rice and vegetables are hot in the pan and ready for a boost, you simply melt a flavor cube or two in the mix and let the rice take on a tasty coat of green.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/25/dining/25DIRTJP6/25DIRTJP6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "1 cup (about 1 ice cube tray)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "cilantro, parsley, spinach, thai basil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 659}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 33, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "63 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup cilantro", "2/3 cup parsley", "2/3 cup Thai basil", "4 cups spinach", "2 cloves garlic, peeled", "2 tablespoons peeled and chopped fresh ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Tear all the stems off the herbs and spinach.
