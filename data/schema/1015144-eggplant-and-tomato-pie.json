Spoon one third of the remaining sauce over the eggplant and sprinkle with thyme, Parmesan, and half of the Gruy\u00e8re. Repeat the layers one or two more times, depending on the size of your eggplant slices, ending with the Gruy\u00e8re. Pour on the egg and milk mixture. It should seep down into the layers; if it looks like it\u2019s not moving and going to overflow the crust, use a fork to create some holes so it does seep down. Arrange the sliced tomatoes on top and sprinkle any remaining thyme over the tomatoes. Drizzle on 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Place in the oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until set and bubbling and browned on the top and edges. Remove from the heat and allow to sit for at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve hot, warm, or room temperature."}]}
