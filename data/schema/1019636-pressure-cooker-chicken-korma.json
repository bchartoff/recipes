{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Chicken Korma", "description": "Flavored with cardamom and saffron-infused cream, then garnished with golden raisins and slivered almonds, chicken korma is a delicate and elegant dish. This version, by the cookbook author Madhur Jaffrey, is quickly made in an electric pressure cooker. You can substitute chicken breasts here, as long as you buy them still on the bone. Boneless chicken is apt to overcook. Serve this over basmati rice to soak up the rich, creamy sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/10apperex3/10apperex3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, curries", "keywords": "almond, cardamom pods, chicken thighs, golden raisin, heavy cream, saffron, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 361}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 539, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "546 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup heavy cream", "A very generous pinch of saffron threads, plus more if you can afford it", "6 skinless, bone-in chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)", "1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "Black pepper", "1/4 cup peanut or olive oil", "3 tablespoons golden raisins", "3 tablespoons slivered blanched almonds", "5 whole green cardamom pods", "1 medium stick cinnamon", "1 medium onion, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/2 cup plain yogurt", "1/4 to 1 teaspoon chile powder, to taste", "1/2 teaspoon garam masala"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat cream in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove, then add the saffron.
