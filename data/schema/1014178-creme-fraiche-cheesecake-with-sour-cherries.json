Here, you\u2019ll use cream cheese, goat cheese and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to concoct a light, fluffy cheesecake that isn\u2019t too sweet, making it the perfect platform to show off a bunch of summer cherries, simmered in sugar. Or you could skip the cherries and eat it plain, or drizzle over some honey and toasted nuts.
