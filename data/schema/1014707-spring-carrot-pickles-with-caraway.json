Bring the water to a boil, remove from the heat and add to the vinegar and sugar mixture. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the salt and stir well. Pour over the carrots and caraway, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 days before eating and for up to 2 weeks. These taste best with a longer brine, as the caraway has more time to infuse the brine. Shake the jar from time to time or, if you use a bowl, place a saucer on top of the carrots to keep them submerged. Remove from the brine with a slotted spoon to serve."}]}
