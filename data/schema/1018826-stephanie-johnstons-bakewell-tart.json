As <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015673-tart-dough\">for the crust</a>, both Steph and her mom make a plain, all-butter crust, think p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e or pie dough.\u00a0We polished off Steph\u2019s tart in one go after dinner, but had we shown more discipline, it would have kept at room temperature for three more days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/02/magazine/02dessert1/02mag-02dessert.t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almond flour, egg, raspberry jam, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 444, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "116 milligrams", "sugarContent": "42 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unbaked tart crust in a 9-inch fluted pan <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015673-tart-dough\">(see recipe here)</a>", "1 1/4 cups (125 grams) almond flour", "1/2 cup (68 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1 stick (113 grams) unsalted butter, very soft", "1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "1 jar (340 to 370 grams) raspberry jam, to make 1 slightly rounded cup", "1/3 cup sliced almonds (optional)", "1/2 cup (60 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 to 1 tablespoon water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and preheat it to 400.
