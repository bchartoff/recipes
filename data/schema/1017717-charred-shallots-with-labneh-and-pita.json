{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Charred Shallots With Labneh and Pita", "description": "The flavor of roasted caramelized onions is a universal favorite that add sweetness and depth to countless recipes. When grilled, the onions \u2014 and in this case shallots \u2014 take on a smoky char as well. Here, they are served on top of thick labneh (strained Middle Eastern yogurt) to be eaten as a side or an unusual dip with grilled pita. This recipe calls for grilling the shallots slowly over indirect heat, giving them plenty of time to soften, brown and absorb the smoke. Or you can use the oven instead if need be, but you won't get that smoky flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/23/multimedia/clark-grilled-shallots/clark-grilled-shallots-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, labneh, pita, shallot, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 339, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "607 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium shallots", "1 medium white onion", "5 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley, plus a handful of whole leaves", "1 tablespoon chopped mint, plus a handful of whole leaves", "1 tablespoon finely chopped preserved lemon", "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "Kosher salt, as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "2 cups labneh or full-fat Greek yogurt", "Sumac, as needed", "Grilled pita, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel shallots and halve lengthwise through root end.
