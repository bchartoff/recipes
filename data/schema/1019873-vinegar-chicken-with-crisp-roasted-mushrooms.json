{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vinegar Chicken With Crisp Roasted Mushrooms", "description": "Not quite a braise and quicker than a roast, this saucy, tangy one-pot vinegar chicken can be prepared in under an hour with ingredients you probably have on hand. Feel free to use a whole chicken broken down into parts or any combination of breasts, legs, thighs and-or drumsticks, making sure whatever you use is bone-in and skin-on. While the crisp roasted mushrooms and lettuces are optional, they\u2019re unfussy ways to elevate this dish without adding much time to the preparation. Crunchy toast to soak up all the juices is another low-key, brilliant item to add to the table, as is a bowl of seasoned sour cream, which will act as part dressing for the lettuces, part topping for the toast and part dipping sauce for the chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/dining/02roman3/merlin_148228476_1d166f39-0b22-4d00-8be3-da223d47db1e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, lettuce, mushroom, sumac, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 679}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 764, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1245 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken (use any combination of legs, thighs or drumsticks, or breasts halved crosswise)", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "2 medium red onions, cut into 1-inch wedges", "1/4 cup white distilled vinegar", "1/2 bunch thyme, plus leaves for garnish", "2 pounds mixed mushrooms, such as shiitake, maitake, button, chanterelle or oyster, torn into large pieces or quartered", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "2 to 3 heads Little Gem lettuces, ends trimmed, quartered lengthwise", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "Sumac, for sprinkling", "Olive oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken with salt and pepper.
