{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon With Potatoes and Horseradish-Tarragon Sauce", "description": "Adapted from an 18th-century recipe by George Lang for his 1971 cookbook, \u201cThe Cuisine of Hungary,\u201d this recipe layers roast potatoes with just-tender baked salmon and a fresh swipe of horseradish sauce. You could substitute the potatoes with carrots, beets or other root vegetables, or you could play around with more tender vegetables like zucchini or fennel, though you\u2019d need to slice them more thickly and reduce the cook time in Step 1. Likewise, halibut, cod or another white fish can be used instead of salmon. The bright horseradish sauce keeps the salmon moist and gives this dish verve, pairing horseradish\u2019s peppery punch with tangy sour cream and fresh herbs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/dining/08horseradishrex2/merlin_152756181_a3e7a691-4ff0-49df-9d91-92a675e0cd13-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, seafood", "keywords": "horseradish, potato, salmon, sour cream, tarragon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 340}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 489, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "698 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 pound), unpeeled", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup chopped shallots", "1 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt", "1/3 cup drained\u00a0prepared horseradish", "3 tablespoons tarragon", "3 tablespoons minced chives", "1/8 teaspoon white pepper (optional)", "2 pounds boneless, skinless salmon or halibut fillet", "1 teaspoon hot paprika"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and liberally grease a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish with butter.
